Aaron Edlin,6,Berkeley,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: Replacing the current US health insurance system as outlined in a) would lead to lower aggregate innovation in the pharmaceutical industry.,Medicare is likely to pay less for drugs leading to less innovation.

Aaron Edlin,17,Berkeley,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for making significant progress in poverty reduction.,
Aaron Edlin,18,Berkeley,m,7,6,Uncertain,Agree,Question A: Rising inequality is straining the health of liberal democracy.,A bigger problem might be that incomes haven’t increased meaningfully for the poor nor the middle class

Aaron Edlin,20,Berkeley,m,6,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question C:

Aaron Edlin,27,Berkeley,m,8,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Mexico's persistent bilateral trade surplus with the United States implies that Mexico is following policies that keep the peso artificially weak against the US dollar.,Not necessarily. I run a persistent trade surplus with my employer. I want their money but not their goods.
Aaron Edlin,28,Berkeley,m,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: The existence of a multi-year trade deficit of Country A with Country B implies that B has successfully tilted the playing field in its favor in terms of such policies as tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and the exchange rate between them.",

Aaron Edlin,36,Berkeley,m,5,5,Disagree,Agree,Question A: Senator Warren’s proposed wealth tax would be much more difficult to enforce than existing federal taxes because of difficulties of valuation and the ways by which the wealthy can under-report their true wealth.,One way to avoid under reporting with some assets is to allow anyone to buy at declared valuations. Another is large penalties.

Aaron Edlin,48,Berkeley,m,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Raising the top federal marginal tax on earned personal income to 70% (and holding the rest of the current tax code, including the top bracket definition, fixed) would raise substantially more revenue (federal and state, combined) without lowering economic activity.",
Aaron Edlin,49,Berkeley,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Rather than using second-round runoffs to settle elections in which no candidate wins a first-round majority, it would be better to use ranked-choice voting (as in the state of Maine) in which voters are encouraged to rank all of the candidates.",
Aaron Edlin,50,Berkeley,m,7,6,Agree,Agree,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Aaron Edlin,51,Berkeley,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question A: Considering a broad range of costs and benefits is a better tool for guiding climate policy than setting temperature limits (such as 1.5 °C , eg) based on expected links between temperature increases and the extent of environmental harm.",

Aaron Edlin,67,Berkeley,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Disagree,"The biggest reason for the measured slowdown in US productivity growth since the mid-2000s is that productivity increases have gone mismeasured, including new and better products and services that have been insufficiently captured by real output data.",

Aaron Edlin,234,Berkeley,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Although they do not always agree about the precise likely effects of different tax policies, another reason why economists often give disparate advice on tax policy is because they hold differing views about choices between raising average prosperity and redistributing income.",

Thirty years ago, before interstate branching was fully permitted, that combined share was around 8% (an average of 2% each).

Anil Kashyap,205,Chicago,m,5,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because the US has underspent on new projects, maintenance, or both, the federal government has an opportunity to increase average incomes by spending more on roads, railways, bridges and airports.",Repairing bridges & roads would have been good to do over the last 5 years; the problem is nothing is really shovel ready so it takes time
Anil Kashyap,206,Chicago,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Past experience of public spending and political economy suggests that if the government spent more on roads, railways, bridges and airports, many of the projects would have low or negative returns.","Depends on what ""many"" means, but dollar weighted we do overpay too often. See Calif high speed train"
Anil Kashyap,207,Chicago,m,5,6,Agree,Agree,Reducing the income-tax deductibility of charitable gifts is a less distortionary way to raise new revenue than raising the same amount of revenue through a proportional increase in all marginal tax rates.,

Anil Kashyap,210,Chicago,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Refusing to liberalize trade unless partner countries adopt new labor or environmental rules is a bad policy, because even if the new standards would reduce distortions on some dimensions, such a policy involves threatening to maintain large distortions in the form of restricted trade.","OK to threaten it, but losing a deal over this would be bad policy; this reasoning seems to make it much harder to reach deals."
Anil Kashyap,211,Chicago,m,NA,4,No Opinion,Uncertain,Using government funds to guarantee preschool education for four-year olds would yield a much lower social return than the ones achieved by the most highly touted targeted preschool initiatives.,Too far from my expertise to say.
Anil Kashyap,212,Chicago,m,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment.,"For some it will definitely reduce opportunities, but in other places it will not even be binding Net effect is hard to tell"
Anil Kashyap,213,Chicago,m,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: The distortionary costs of raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour and indexing it to inflation are sufficiently small compared with the benefits to low-skilled workers who can find employment that this would be a desirable policy.,"Total effects are hard to tell, plus there are other policies like the EITC that might be more effective."

Anil Kashyap,216,Chicago,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Because all federal spending and taxes must be approved by both houses of Congress and the executive branch, a separate debt ceiling that has to be increased periodically creates unneeded uncertainty and can potentially lead to worse fiscal outcomes.",Deciding whether or not to pay the debts incurred to fund the previously approved tax and spending is nuts.
Anil Kashyap,217,Chicago,m,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,The federal government would make the average U.S. citizen better off by using policies that directly focus more on increasing small business growth than growth of economic output overall.,"Small biz create and destroy lots of jobs, there is no reason to favor them at the expense of others

Anil Kashyap,218,Chicago,m,7,6,Agree,Uncertain,The annual indexing of Social Security benefits to increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (the CPI-W) leads to higher benefits than would be required to compensate recipients for genuine cost-of-living increases.,"Directionally almost has to be true, but the magnitude is uncertain."
Anil Kashyap,219,Chicago,m,1,7,Agree,Agree,"The Brookings Institution recently described a US carbon tax of $20 per ton, increasing at 4% per year, which would raise an estimated $150 billion per year in federal revenues over the next decade. Given the negative externalities created by carbon dioxide emissions, a federal carbon tax at this rate would involve fewer harmful net distortions to the US economy than a tax increase that generated the same revenue by raising marginal tax rates on labor income across the board.",
Anil Kashyap,220,Chicago,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will continue to grow under current policy beyond the 10-year window of most political budget debates, it is easy for a politician to devise a budget plan that would reduce federal deficits over the next decade without really making the U.S. fiscally sustainable.",
Anil Kashyap,221,Chicago,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Comparing two plans that would reduce federal budget deficits by identical amounts in each of the next 10 years, one that did so partly by reducing significantly the long-term growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid spending would do more to make the U.S. budget fiscally sustainable than one that did not lower the growth of these spending programs.","Medicare and Medicaid are (along with growth) the key factors for long term sustainability. We never paid for the Bush plan, let alone ACA."

Anil Kashyap,224,Chicago,m,7,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question C: Taking into account all of the economic consequences — including effects on corporate managers' incentives and on creditors' expectations of how their claims will be treated in future bankruptcies — the benefits of bailing out GM and Chrysler will end up exceeding the costs.,Costs will appear in the next crisis; the precedent for a bailout is now set. Reduced incentives for the private sector to hold dry powder.
Anil Kashyap,225,Chicago,m,7,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: The U.S government should make further efforts to shrink the size of the country's largest banks — such as by capping the size of their liabilities or penalizing large banks more heavily through taxes or other means — because the existing regulations do not require the biggest banks to internalize enough of the ""too-big-to-fail"" risks that they pose.",Many ways to use derivatives and other regulatory loopholes to avoid these penalties. So we could make things less safe. Details matter.
Anil Kashyap,226,Chicago,m,1,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: The economic benefits to the U.S. of having a handful of banks with balance sheets greater than $1 trillion are small.,US firms are big in all industries and balance sheet size is an imperfect measure. But evidence on scale and scope efficiences is weak.
Anil Kashyap,227,Chicago,m,5,6,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: The federal government would make the average U.S. citizen better off by using policies that directly focus more on increasing manufacturing employment than employment in other sectors.,Memo to Romney and Obama: there is nothing per se special about manufacturing (except maybe nostalgia).
Anil Kashyap,228,Chicago,m,NA,6,No Opinion,Agree,"Question B: Because firms and inventors do not capture the full returns from research and development, the government would increase the average well-being of Americans (and potentially of others too) by favoring R&D using the tax code.",Not sure of the magnitudes of the distortions once we account for patents and other R&D policies
Anil Kashyap,229,Chicago,m,3,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Consider one of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that President Obama enacted in the Affordable Care Act — reducing Medicare-related payments to private insurers and altering the payment system for doctors and hospitals — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because over time the supply of doctors, hospitals and insurers willing to offer them health services may decline in response to restrained payments.",Assuming that they actually hold the line on payments.
Anil Kashyap,230,Chicago,m,3,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Consider the other of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that Governor Romney advocates — giving future seniors a fixed payment for premiums and letting private insurers compete with Medicare — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because competition may not be powerful to enough to offer future seniors the same quality of care that is currently promised without supplementing their premium support.",Also risky assuming premium support is limited; some cherry picking could also cause problems for traditional Medicare
Anil Kashyap,231,Chicago,m,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Claims by incumbent presidents and challengers about how many private-sector jobs can be created in a four-year period by sector-level or other targeted policies should be viewed as rough guesses, because overall macroeconomic conditions drive aggregate employment in ways that dominate any net effects of polices that focus on specific industries or households.",POTUS macro choices matter somewhat but most sexy attempts to pander to get votes are inconsequental & shocks they can't control are big.
Anil Kashyap,232,Chicago,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: One drawback of taxing capital income at a lower rate than labor income is that it gives people incentives to relabel income that policymakers find hard to categorize as ""capital"" rather than labor"".","don't know how successful they are, but the incentives are clear"
Anil Kashyap,233,Chicago,m,1,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Despite relabeling concerns, taxing capital income at a permanently lower rate than labor income would result in higher average long-term prosperity, relative to an alternative that generated the same amount of tax revenue by permanently taxing capital and labor income at equal rates instead.",But the levels of rates matter and just getting the rate capital down might have no meaningful effects.
Anil Kashyap,234,Chicago,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question C: Although they do not always agree about the precise likely effects of different tax policies, another reason why economists often give disparate advice on tax policy is because they hold differing views about choices between raising average prosperity and redistributing income.","This is a powerful factor that is often overlooked: the efficiency vs equity debate is still alive, even if sometimes hidden."
Anil Kashyap,235,Chicago,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: By discounting pension liabilities at high interest rates under government accounting standards, many U.S. state and local governments understate their pension liabilities and the costs of providing pensions to public-sector workers.","Its outrageous that this is permitted.

Anil Kashyap,236,Chicago,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: During the next two decades some U.S. states, unless they substantially increase taxes, cut spending, and/or change public-sector pensions, will require a combination of severe austerity budgets, a federal bailout, and/or default.","Current path is unsustainable; the longer we wait the worse the eventual adjustment, but for OH and IL at least things already look bad.

Anil Kashyap,237,Chicago,m,7,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Even if the third round of quantitative easing that the Fed recently announced increases real GDP growth over the next two years, the increase will be inconsequential.","Too many other negative pressures around the world (europe, fiscal cliff, china) for the Fed's policy to make much difference"
Anil Kashyap,238,Chicago,m,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Even if the third round of quantitative easing that the Fed recently announced increases annual consumer price inflation over the next five years, the increase will be inconsequential.",Only way this is incorrect is if the Fed ignores lots of warnings. Given current FOMC membership that risk is small.
Anil Kashyap,239,Chicago,m,10,5,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question C: Even if inflationary pressures rise substantially as a result of quantitative easing and low interest rates, the Federal Reserve has ample tools to rein inflation back in if it chooses to do so.",Lots of ways to tighten and failure to do so would have to be an active choice.
Anil Kashyap,240,Chicago,m,3,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: Ethanol content requirements and protectionism against imported ethanol (which includes fuel from sugarcane) raise food prices without significantly reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.,
Anil Kashyap,241,Chicago,m,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: A direct disincentive to emit carbon-dioxide, for example through a carbon tax or an emissions permit market, is more efficient than requiring the use of corn-based ethanol fuels.",
Anil Kashyap,242,Chicago,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question A: Even if all the official-sector funding that Greece received from 2010 through August 2012 is written off, propping up Greece to buy time for the rest of Europe to prepare for Greek default has been better for citizens of the Eurozone outside of Greece than a policy that would have cut off funding sooner.",Better to have backstopped all the banks and let Greece default in early 2010 -- contagion was manageable then if the banks were supported
Anil Kashyap,243,Chicago,m,3,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question B: A substantial sovereign-debt default by some combination of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain is a necessary condition for the euro area as a whole to grow at its pre-crisis trend rate over the next three years.",ECB could inflate things away (and maybe the OMT is the first step) which is another form of default.
Anil Kashyap,244,Chicago,m,3,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question C: Unless there is a substantial default by some combination of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain on their sovereign debt and commercial bank debt, plus credible reforms to prevent excessive borrowing in the future, the euro area is headed for a costly financial meltdown and a prolonged recession.","Again inflating is the alternative -- a clean restructuring is probably better, but inflation may be the path of least resistance."
Anil Kashyap,245,Chicago,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,The current trade barriers in the U.S. sugar industry raise the profits of sugar producers and make the typical U.S. consumer pay more for sugar and goods that use sugar as an input.,
Anil Kashyap,246,Chicago,m,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Loans to students attending for-profit colleges are especially risky because students attending them have had default rates that greatly exceed those for comparable students attending public and non-profit private institutions.,
Anil Kashyap,247,Chicago,m,1,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: Rules that tie each college's eligibility for federal student loans to its students' graduation rates and post-schooling employment outcomes would better protect taxpayers from losses on student loans.,"Depends on not forbearing, or picking up costs of past bad private loans. Will the government really put lots of people in debtors prison?"
Anil Kashyap,248,Chicago,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: The way in which money market funds normally trade – at one dollar per share, even though the per-share value of the assets backing them varies over time – made them vulnerable to a run in 2008 before they received taxpayer guarantees.","The current structure of MMMFs makes them susceptible to runs. So an ugly blow up in Europe could spread to the US via the MMMFs.

Anil Kashyap,249,Chicago,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,Question B: Taxpayers would be better protected if each money market fund in the U.S. were instead required to trade at its floating net asset value.,Floating NAV definitely ends the risk of a run. Only caveat is what happens to the money that MIGHT migrate. Could be a whack a mole issue
Anil Kashyap,250,Chicago,m,7,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Question C: In the absence of floating net asset values, taxpayers would be better protected if each money market fund in the U.S. were required to set aside capital to protect against losses while holding back a portion of shareholders' cash for a time when they seek to withdraw all of their money.",SEC has a chance to require this and it would help. This probably leads to more migration than floating NAV.
Anil Kashyap,251,Chicago,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,Taxes or bans on large bottles of soft drinks containing sugar are not likely to have a significant effect on obesity rates because people will substitute towards consuming excessive calories in other ways.,
Anil Kashyap,252,Chicago,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Subjecting online sales from out-of-state vendors to the same retail sales taxes imposed on in-state sales would raise more tax revenue in the states making this change while reducing the pro-online bias of current policy.,Leveling the playing field & raising money is good policy; rationalizing the many jurisdictions & various tax rates would be good too.
Anil Kashyap,253,Chicago,m,7,5,Agree,Agree,"Consumers would not necessarily be better off if cable and satellite TV firms were required to offer a la carte pricing for individual channels, because the networks' programming charges and the satellite-and-cable fees could adjust in response to this rule.",A la carte unfortunately is not a panacea.
Anil Kashyap,254,Chicago,m,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Long run fiscal sustainability in the U.S. will require cuts in currently promised Medicare and Medicaid benefits and/or tax increases that include higher taxes on households with incomes below $250,000.","Can't escape doing something about medical spending and even if we do, we will need more taxes on everyone

Anil Kashyap,255,Chicago,m,7,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: Assuming that Germany eventually agrees to backstop the debt of southern European countries, the eurozone as a whole will be better off if that bailout is unconditional, rather than accompanied by the labor market reforms and future budget controls that Germany is demanding of countries in return.",Without the structural reforms these countries medium term outlook is grim.
Anil Kashyap,256,Chicago,m,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: If Germany fails to bail out the southern tier of Europe, its own economy will be hurt more — because of output and asset losses — than it would be by an unconditional bailout.",Too many factors about the details of a break up and the policies followed under a bailout need to be specified to answer this.
Anil Kashyap,257,Chicago,m,7,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question C: The main reason other eurozone countries need to worry about Greek banks losing access to ECB support is because the ensuing chaos in Greece could trigger bank runs in peripheral countries.,"Greece is doomed absent a complete bailout. But then how do Port, Italy, Spain not get the same deal? When Greece collapses watch for runs"
Anil Kashyap,258,Chicago,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: A cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would lead to higher GDP within five years than without the tax cut.,Lots of distorting effects of taxes. Costs of higher deficits probably modest at the 5 year horizon; eventually can't just keep borrowing.
Anil Kashyap,259,Chicago,m,7,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question B: A cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut.,"May look plausible on a cocktail napkin (or at a cocktail party), but not true empirically in the US."
Anil Kashyap,260,Chicago,m,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Trade with China makes most Americans better off because, among other advantages, they can buy goods that are made or assembled more cheaply in China.",Failure to understand this is one of biggest common misperceptions by politicians and the general public
Anil Kashyap,261,Chicago,m,1,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Some Americans who work in the production of competing goods, such as clothing and furniture, are made worse off by trade with China.",Over the medium run there should be some adjustment and if China were not in the picture some other country probably would be.
Anil Kashyap,262,Chicago,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,too many competing hypotheses and I don't know enough about the evidence to pick between them
Anil Kashyap,263,Chicago,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"If the fiscal changes that are planned under current US law take place next year — including Bush era tax cuts expiring, Medicare payment rates to doctors being cut, the AMT applying to many more taxpayers, and automatic cuts in defense and non-defense discretionary spending kicking in — then US real GDP growth in 2013 will be lower than it would be under the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, in which the above changes do not occur.",Short run contraction for sure. But long run costs of NOT acting are growing; entitlement reform and some revenue increases are needed.
Anil Kashyap,264,Chicago,m,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,"New technology for fracking natural gas, by lowering energy costs in the United States, will make US industrial firms more cost competitive and thus significantly stimulate the growth of US merchandise exports.","3 uncertain steps.

Anil Kashyap,265,Chicago,m,7,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Cuba’s low per-capita income growth — 1.2 percent per year since 1960 —has more to do with Cuba’s own economic policies than with the U.S. embargo on trade and tourism.,"Gravity model suggests adverse effects from the embargo, but destroying the price system and using command and control instead hurts more."
Anil Kashyap,266,Chicago,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Reducing the minimum retirement age in France from 62 back to age 60, permanently, would reduce long-term French economic growth and substantially raise French debt relative to GDP over time.","Lower labor supply reduces growth.

Anil Kashyap,273,Chicago,m,5,5,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: The main drawback to allowing all public school students to take the government money (local, state, federal) currently being spent on their own education and turning that money into vouchers that they could use towards covering the costs of any private school or public school of their choice (e.g. charter schools) would be that some students would not make an active choice and would be left with much worse peers and a weaker school.","I see this as the main cost; it is not clear how long people would be trapped, but initially at least some undoubtedly would be worse off."

Christopher Udry,225,Northwestern,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: The U.S government should make further efforts to shrink the size of the country's largest banks — such as by capping the size of their liabilities or penalizing large banks more heavily through taxes or other means — because the existing regulations do not require the biggest banks to internalize enough of the ""too-big-to-fail"" risks that they pose.",

Christopher Udry,262,Northwestern,m,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,It's not clear to me that this is an important factor outside a limited number of disciplines.

Darrell Duffie,36,Stanford,m,1,5,Agree,Agree,Question A: Senator Warren’s proposed wealth tax would be much more difficult to enforce than existing federal taxes because of difficulties of valuation and the ways by which the wealthy can under-report their true wealth.,The experience in France is apparently that this is a difficult form of tax to implement.

Darrell Duffie,144,Stanford,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a city or state typically generates local benefits that outweigh the costs to the city and/or state providing the incentives.,"If it was not to the benefit of the local government, why would they do it?"
Darrell Duffie,145,Stanford,m,3,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question B: The US as a whole benefits when cities or states compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,"On its face, this sort of competition is useful. I can imagine that experts on this issue may suggest some unintended related distortions."
Darrell Duffie,146,Stanford,m,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Declining to be vaccinated against contagious diseases such as measles imposes costs on other people, which is a negative externality.","The word "" contagion"" and the adverse consequence of disease directly imply the result, logically."
Darrell Duffie,147,Stanford,m,3,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Considering the costs of restricting free choice, and the share of people in the US who choose not to vaccinate their children for measles, the social benefit of mandating measles vaccines for all Americans (except those with compelling medical reasons) would exceed the social cost.","Strictly speaking, social choice in this setting is not obvious. Here, many benefit significantly at hopefully a small cost by fewer."
Darrell Duffie,148,Stanford,m,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"In 10 years, per capita purchasing power in Greece will be higher if — rather than continuing to service its debts over the next decade and complying with the budget rules currently in place — it refuses to accept a continuation of its current troika program and explicitly defaults on its debt held by the official sector.","It's a tough tradeoff.

Darrell Duffie,219,Stanford,m,3,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will continue to grow under current policy beyond the 10-year window of most political budget debates, it is easy for a politician to devise a budget plan that would reduce federal deficits over the next decade without really making the U.S. fiscally sustainable.",
Darrell Duffie,220,Stanford,m,3,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Comparing two plans that would reduce federal budget deficits by identical amounts in each of the next 10 years, one that did so partly by reducing significantly the long-term growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid spending would do more to make the U.S. budget fiscally sustainable than one that did not lower the growth of these spending programs.",

Darrell Duffie,224,Stanford,m,8,6,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: The U.S government should make further efforts to shrink the size of the country's largest banks — such as by capping the size of their liabilities or penalizing large banks more heavily through taxes or other means — because the existing regulations do not require the biggest banks to internalize enough of the ""too-big-to-fail"" risks that they pose.","I am open minded about a size cap, but before taking this action, I think more research should be done on unintended consequences."

Darrell Duffie,230,Stanford,m,2,8,Agree,Agree,"Claims by incumbent presidents and challengers about how many private-sector jobs can be created in a four-year period by sector-level or other targeted policies should be viewed as rough guesses, because overall macroeconomic conditions drive aggregate employment in ways that dominate any net effects of polices that focus on specific industries or households.",
Darrell Duffie,231,Stanford,m,3,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: One drawback of taxing capital income at a lower rate than labor income is that it gives people incentives to relabel income that policymakers find hard to categorize as ""capital"" rather than labor"".","The incentive this creates to recategorize is clear. That this results in a drawback seems right, but less clear to me."
Darrell Duffie,232,Stanford,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Despite relabeling concerns, taxing capital income at a permanently lower rate than labor income would result in higher average long-term prosperity, relative to an alternative that generated the same amount of tax revenue by permanently taxing capital and labor income at equal rates instead.","This seems right on average to me, but does it need to be true under all conditions? Of this I am less confident."
Darrell Duffie,233,Stanford,m,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question C: Although they do not always agree about the precise likely effects of different tax policies, another reason why economists often give disparate advice on tax policy is because they hold differing views about choices between raising average prosperity and redistributing income.",My anecdotal experience is that economists differ widely on the relative costs of income heterogeneity (equity versus efficiency).
Darrell Duffie,234,Stanford,m,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: By discounting pension liabilities at high interest rates under government accounting standards, many U.S. state and local governments understate their pension liabilities and the costs of providing pensions to public-sector workers.","The discounting is unrealistically high, so underfunding is understated.

Darrell Duffie,238,Stanford,m,9,5,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Even if inflationary pressures rise substantially as a result of quantitative easing and low interest rates, the Federal Reserve has ample tools to rein inflation back in if it chooses to do so.","Yes, it clearly has the tools, but will it use them quickly and aggressively, especially given the short-run cost in jobs? We may find out."
Darrell Duffie,239,Stanford,m,2,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: Ethanol content requirements and protectionism against imported ethanol (which includes fuel from sugarcane) raise food prices without significantly reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.,"This sounds right, although it relies a bit on some knowledge of the chemistry involved, so I am not completely confident."
Darrell Duffie,240,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: A direct disincentive to emit carbon-dioxide, for example through a carbon tax or an emissions permit market, is more efficient than requiring the use of corn-based ethanol fuels.",It would be pure coincidence if forced substitution of one input for another is efficient. A permit market can give the correct tradeoff.
Darrell Duffie,241,Stanford,m,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Even if all the official-sector funding that Greece received from 2010 through August 2012 is written off, propping up Greece to buy time for the rest of Europe to prepare for Greek default has been better for citizens of the Eurozone outside of Greece than a policy that would have cut off funding sooner.","An immediate default would have left some Euro zone banks unprepared, and possibly have generated runs. That risk is now reduced."
Darrell Duffie,242,Stanford,m,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: A substantial sovereign-debt default by some combination of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain is a necessary condition for the euro area as a whole to grow at its pre-crisis trend rate over the next three years.",More restructuring might help a lot if managed carefully.

Darrell Duffie,243,Stanford,m,7,4,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question C: Unless there is a substantial default by some combination of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain on their sovereign debt and commercial bank debt, plus credible reforms to prevent excessive borrowing in the future, the euro area is headed for a costly financial meltdown and a prolonged recession.","The question leaves no other options for avoiding meltdown. There are other options, including muddling through with ECB support."
Darrell Duffie,244,Stanford,m,1,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,The current trade barriers in the U.S. sugar industry raise the profits of sugar producers and make the typical U.S. consumer pay more for sugar and goods that use sugar as an input.,"Economics 101. Lowering the supply (from foreign sources), leads the price to go up. At each price, a tariff lowers the foreign supply."
Darrell Duffie,245,Stanford,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,Question A: Loans to students attending for-profit colleges are especially risky because students attending them have had default rates that greatly exceed those for comparable students attending public and non-profit private institutions.,
Darrell Duffie,246,Stanford,m,1,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: Rules that tie each college's eligibility for federal student loans to its students' graduation rates and post-schooling employment outcomes would better protect taxpayers from losses on student loans.,Sounds reasonable that loans should not be provided if they are not having a sufficiently good measured impact.
Darrell Duffie,247,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: The way in which money market funds normally trade – at one dollar per share, even though the per-share value of the assets backing them varies over time – made them vulnerable to a run in 2008 before they received taxpayer guarantees.","In 2008, Institutional investors ran, redeeming shares at a dollar each when a risk arose that this might later become impossible.

Darrell Duffie,248,Stanford,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,Question B: Taxpayers would be better protected if each money market fund in the U.S. were instead required to trade at its floating net asset value.,This would lower the incentive to be the first to run. These runs are destructive.
Darrell Duffie,249,Stanford,m,10,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Question C: In the absence of floating net asset values, taxpayers would be better protected if each money market fund in the U.S. were required to set aside capital to protect against losses while holding back a portion of shareholders' cash for a time when they seek to withdraw all of their money.","This would lower run risk, analogous to bank capital requirements as a mitigant of depositor runs.

Darrell Duffie,250,Stanford,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,Taxes or bans on large bottles of soft drinks containing sugar are not likely to have a significant effect on obesity rates because people will substitute towards consuming excessive calories in other ways.,I don't have the necessary knowledge to handle this one.
Darrell Duffie,251,Stanford,m,2,7,Agree,Agree,Subjecting online sales from out-of-state vendors to the same retail sales taxes imposed on in-state sales would raise more tax revenue in the states making this change while reducing the pro-online bias of current policy.,"I don't know whether some states have been consciously ""pro on line."" I don't follow this policy area."
Darrell Duffie,252,Stanford,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Agree,"Consumers would not necessarily be better off if cable and satellite TV firms were required to offer a la carte pricing for individual channels, because the networks' programming charges and the satellite-and-cable fees could adjust in response to this rule.","I hardly ever watch television, let alone follow the industry.

Darrell Duffie,256,Stanford,m,8,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question C: The main reason other eurozone countries need to worry about Greek banks losing access to ECB support is because the ensuing chaos in Greece could trigger bank runs in peripheral countries.,Banks runs are often triggered by self fulfulling expectations. A run in Greece could tip expectations toward a run elsewhere.
Darrell Duffie,257,Stanford,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: A cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would lead to higher GDP within five years than without the tax cut.,
Darrell Duffie,258,Stanford,m,3,7,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,Question B: A cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut.,"This calls for a model. A lower tax rate applied to higher earnings could raise or lower tax revenue, depending on the extent of growth."

Darrell Duffie,261,Stanford,m,2,5,Agree,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,
Darrell Duffie,262,Stanford,m,2,7,Agree,Agree,"If the fiscal changes that are planned under current US law take place next year — including Bush era tax cuts expiring, Medicare payment rates to doctors being cut, the AMT applying to many more taxpayers, and automatic cuts in defense and non-defense discretionary spending kicking in — then US real GDP growth in 2013 will be lower than it would be under the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, in which the above changes do not occur.",These measures could lower growth in 2013; the alternative has projected deficits of 5.3% (vs 1.4%) for many years; that's not good either!
Darrell Duffie,263,Stanford,m,1,5,Agree,Disagree,"New technology for fracking natural gas, by lowering energy costs in the United States, will make US industrial firms more cost competitive and thus significantly stimulate the growth of US merchandise exports.",The question did not ask whether the associated envirnomental costs are large. I do not know the answer to that question.
Darrell Duffie,264,Stanford,m,2,6,Agree,Agree,Cuba’s low per-capita income growth — 1.2 percent per year since 1960 —has more to do with Cuba’s own economic policies than with the U.S. embargo on trade and tourism.,"The embargo is also likely to have been an important factor, and may be partly responsible for sustaining Cuba's internal economic policies."
Darrell Duffie,265,Stanford,m,4,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Reducing the minimum retirement age in France from 62 back to age 60, permanently, would reduce long-term French economic growth and substantially raise French debt relative to GDP over time.","This would lower tax revenues, increase retirement benefits, and lower output."

Darrell Duffie,273,Stanford,m,9,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: The average size of the 19 financial firms that just completed the Federal Reserve stress tests (i.e. the CCAR) would be substantially smaller if they did not have implicit government support.,Tbtf implies cheap debt financing of assets. There are other reasons to be big. Big clients often want large deals or one-stop shopping.
Darrell Duffie,274,Stanford,m,9,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: The 19 financial firms that just completed the Federal Reserve stress tests (i.e. the CCAR) are big primarily because of economies of scale and scope, rather than because of implicit government support.","Both factors are likely to be present, but we lack sufficient research on magnitudes."
Darrell Duffie,275,Stanford,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,Changes in U.S. gasoline prices over the past 10 years have predominantly been due to market factors rather than U.S. federal economic or energy policies.,"Supply and demand for oil are relatively global.

Darrell Duffie,278,Stanford,m,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Because the U.S. Treasury bailed out and backstopped banks (by injecting equity into them in late 2008, and later committing to provide public capital to any banks that failed the stress tests and could not raise private capital), the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would have been without these measures.","Macro performance depends partly on credit from banks, which would have otherwise been impaired.

David Autor,262,MIT,m,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,Maybe top colleges set a price at whatever insurer (or government lender) will pay then charge a co-pay to extract remaining surplus...

David Cutler,229,Harvard,m,3,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Consider one of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that President Obama enacted in the Affordable Care Act — reducing Medicare-related payments to private insurers and altering the payment system for doctors and hospitals — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because over time the supply of doctors, hospitals and insurers willing to offer them health services may decline in response to restrained payments.","Every policy has risks, so one can't say no. The evidence suggests this is not major, though."
David Cutler,230,Harvard,m,10,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Consider the other of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that Governor Romney advocates — giving future seniors a fixed payment for premiums and letting private insurers compete with Medicare — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because competition may not be powerful to enough to offer future seniors the same quality of care that is currently promised without supplementing their premium support.",This depends enormously on how the voucher is set wrt expected costs. The proposals involve enormous risks.
David Cutler,231,Harvard,m,6,8,Agree,Agree,"Claims by incumbent presidents and challengers about how many private-sector jobs can be created in a four-year period by sector-level or other targeted policies should be viewed as rough guesses, because overall macroeconomic conditions drive aggregate employment in ways that dominate any net effects of polices that focus on specific industries or households.",Sometimes sectoral policies turn out to be very large -- as with the auto industry and the health care industry.
David Cutler,232,Harvard,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: One drawback of taxing capital income at a lower rate than labor income is that it gives people incentives to relabel income that policymakers find hard to categorize as ""capital"" rather than labor"".",

David Cutler,234,Harvard,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question C: Although they do not always agree about the precise likely effects of different tax policies, another reason why economists often give disparate advice on tax policy is because they hold differing views about choices between raising average prosperity and redistributing income.",I don't like the phrasing of 'average' in the question.

David Cutler,251,Harvard,m,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Taxes or bans on large bottles of soft drinks containing sugar are not likely to have a significant effect on obesity rates because people will substitute towards consuming excessive calories in other ways.,Literature suggests otherwise.
David Cutler,252,Harvard,m,6,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Subjecting online sales from out-of-state vendors to the same retail sales taxes imposed on in-state sales would raise more tax revenue in the states making this change while reducing the pro-online bias of current policy.,
David Cutler,253,Harvard,m,5,5,Agree,Agree,"Consumers would not necessarily be better off if cable and satellite TV firms were required to offer a la carte pricing for individual channels, because the networks' programming charges and the satellite-and-cable fees could adjust in response to this rule.",

David Cutler,262,Harvard,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,

David Cutler,296,Harvard,m,10,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,There are no consequential distortions created by the tax preference that favors obtaining health insurance through employers.,Note that this is not a welfare statement. Many of the distortions are good (eg pooling benefits). And welfare requires a counterfactual.
David Cutler,297,Harvard,m,4,5,Agree,Disagree,"Federal mandates that government purchases should be “buy American” unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, have a significant positive impact on U.S. manufacturing employment.",
David Cutler,298,Harvard,m,3,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Eliminating tax deductions for non-investment personal interest expenses (e.g., on mortgages), with reductions in personal tax rates that are both budget neutral and keep the burden of taxes by income group the same, would lead to more efficient financing decisions by individuals.",Primary impact is likely to be on house prices.
David Cutler,299,Harvard,m,1,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: Reducing the deductibility of interest expenses for non-financial businesses to equalize the overall tax cost of debt and equity financing, while using the extra revenue to reduce personal and corporate tax rates in a budget neutral fashion that also keeps the burden of taxes the same, would lead to more efficient financing decisions by firms.",Not sure I can characterize all of what would happen if we had debt-equity switch.

Edward Lazear,1,Stanford,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"The Brookings Institution recently described a US carbon tax of $20 per ton, increasing at 4% per year, which would raise an estimated $150 billion per year in federal revenues over the next decade. Given the negative externalities created by carbon dioxide emissions, a federal carbon tax at this rate would involve fewer harmful net distortions to the US economy than a tax increase that generated the same revenue by raising marginal tax rates on labor income across the board.",
Edward Lazear,2,Stanford,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question A: Because federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will continue to grow under current policy beyond the 10-year window of most political budget debates, it is easy for a politician to devise a budget plan that would reduce federal deficits over the next decade without really making the U.S. fiscally sustainable.",
Edward Lazear,3,Stanford,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question B: Comparing two plans that would reduce federal budget deficits by identical amounts in each of the next 10 years, one that did so partly by reducing significantly the long-term growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid spending would do more to make the U.S. budget fiscally sustainable than one that did not lower the growth of these spending programs.",
Edward Lazear,4,Stanford,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,Question A: Taking into account all of the economic consequences — including the incentives of banks to ensure their own liquidity and solvency in the future — the benefits of bailing out U.S. banks in 2008 will end up exceeding the costs.,
Edward Lazear,5,Stanford,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question B: Because GM and Chrysler were bailed out in 2008-09, the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would it have been if Congress and the executive branch had not intervened.",

Edward Lazear,13,Stanford,m,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Claims by incumbent presidents and challengers about how many private-sector jobs can be created in a four-year period by sector-level or other targeted policies should be viewed as rough guesses, because overall macroeconomic conditions drive aggregate employment in ways that dominate any net effects of polices that focus on specific industries or households.",
Edward Lazear,14,Stanford,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: One drawback of taxing capital income at a lower rate than labor income is that it gives people incentives to relabel income that policymakers find hard to categorize as ""capital"" rather than labor"".",
Edward Lazear,15,Stanford,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Despite relabeling concerns, taxing capital income at a permanently lower rate than labor income would result in higher average long-term prosperity, relative to an alternative that generated the same amount of tax revenue by permanently taxing capital and labor income at equal rates instead.",
Edward Lazear,16,Stanford,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Although they do not always agree about the precise likely effects of different tax policies, another reason why economists often give disparate advice on tax policy is because they hold differing views about choices between raising average prosperity and redistributing income.",

Edward Lazear,23,Stanford,m,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: A direct disincentive to emit carbon-dioxide, for example through a carbon tax or an emissions permit market, is more efficient than requiring the use of corn-based ethanol fuels.","Standard efficiency argument, but the calclulatiions show large taxes would be required to have any effect. Elasticies are low."
Edward Lazear,24,Stanford,m,6,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question A: Even if all the official-sector funding that Greece received from 2010 through August 2012 is written off, propping up Greece to buy time for the rest of Europe to prepare for Greek default has been better for citizens of the Eurozone outside of Greece than a policy that would have cut off funding sooner.",Danger of contagion has been overstated.

Edward Lazear,27,Stanford,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,The current trade barriers in the U.S. sugar industry raise the profits of sugar producers and make the typical U.S. consumer pay more for sugar and goods that use sugar as an input.,
Edward Lazear,28,Stanford,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,Question A: Loans to students attending for-profit colleges are especially risky because students attending them have had default rates that greatly exceed those for comparable students attending public and non-profit private institutions.,
Edward Lazear,29,Stanford,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Agree,Question B: Rules that tie each college's eligibility for federal student loans to its students' graduation rates and post-schooling employment outcomes would better protect taxpayers from losses on student loans.,
Edward Lazear,30,Stanford,m,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question A: The way in which money market funds normally trade – at one dollar per share, even though the per-share value of the assets backing them varies over time – made them vulnerable to a run in 2008 before they received taxpayer guarantees.",

Edward Lazear,33,Stanford,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,Taxes or bans on large bottles of soft drinks containing sugar are not likely to have a significant effect on obesity rates because people will substitute towards consuming excessive calories in other ways.,
Edward Lazear,34,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Subjecting online sales from out-of-state vendors to the same retail sales taxes imposed on in-state sales would raise more tax revenue in the states making this change while reducing the pro-online bias of current policy.,
Edward Lazear,35,Stanford,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Consumers would not necessarily be better off if cable and satellite TV firms were required to offer a la carte pricing for individual channels, because the networks' programming charges and the satellite-and-cable fees could adjust in response to this rule.",
Edward Lazear,36,Stanford,m,5,8,Uncertain,Agree,"Long run fiscal sustainability in the U.S. will require cuts in currently promised Medicare and Medicaid benefits and/or tax increases that include higher taxes on households with incomes below $250,000.","Cuts or less rapid growth?

Edward Lazear,39,Stanford,m,NA,6,No Opinion,Agree,Question C: The main reason other eurozone countries need to worry about Greek banks losing access to ECB support is because the ensuing chaos in Greece could trigger bank runs in peripheral countries.,
Edward Lazear,40,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: A cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would lead to higher GDP within five years than without the tax cut.,Academic evidence supports this. See Romer and Romer AER 2010; Bergh and Henriksen survey and book. Ed Prescott Eli Lecture 2002.
Edward Lazear,41,Stanford,m,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question B: A cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut.,"This is the Laffer curve issue. There is little (if any) evidence that rates exceed revenue-maximizing levels. See Mankiw, Feldstein."
Edward Lazear,42,Stanford,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Trade with China makes most Americans better off because, among other advantages, they can buy goods that are made or assembled more cheaply in China.","Trade with China has lowered prices paid by the average consumer, in some sectors, by significant amounts."

Edward Lazear,44,Stanford,m,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,Wages of all educated service workers have risen over time. No evidence and competition does not imply increase greater than productivity.
Edward Lazear,45,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"If the fiscal changes that are planned under current US law take place next year — including Bush era tax cuts expiring, Medicare payment rates to doctors being cut, the AMT applying to many more taxpayers, and automatic cuts in defense and non-defense discretionary spending kicking in — then US real GDP growth in 2013 will be lower than it would be under the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, in which the above changes do not occur.","Most of the action is on the tax side as CBO documents.

Edward Lazear,47,Stanford,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,Cuba’s low per-capita income growth — 1.2 percent per year since 1960 —has more to do with Cuba’s own economic policies than with the U.S. embargo on trade and tourism.,See Jamaica v. Barbados and other Caribb. nations that are not embargoed. Their growth depends on local policy. Other evidence as well.
Edward Lazear,48,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Reducing the minimum retirement age in France from 62 back to age 60, permanently, would reduce long-term French economic growth and substantially raise French debt relative to GDP over time.","France is not in terrible budgetary shape, but this won't help.

Edward Lazear,53,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Prior to the crisis, the benefits from the funding advantage that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had by virtue of perceived government support mostly went to their shareholders, rather than into substantially lower interest rates on residential mortgages.","Private issuers could have achieved the same effect absent F/F's govt granted advantage.

Edward Lazear,54,Stanford,m,7,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: If public school students had the option of taking the government money (local, state, federal) currently being spent on their own education and turning that money into vouchers that they could use towards covering the costs of any private school or public school of their choice (e.g. charter schools), most would be better off.",The main disadvantage to vouchers is potential weakening of public schools. But those that would lose students are terrible already.
Edward Lazear,55,Stanford,m,6,5,Disagree,Agree,"Question B: The main drawback to allowing all public school students to take the government money (local, state, federal) currently being spent on their own education and turning that money into vouchers that they could use towards covering the costs of any private school or public school of their choice (e.g. charter schools) would be that some students would not make an active choice and would be left with much worse peers and a weaker school.","Those most likely to be hurt are already in terrible schools.

Edward Lazear,57,Stanford,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,"Question B: The 19 financial firms that just completed the Federal Reserve stress tests (i.e. the CCAR) are big primarily because of economies of scale and scope, rather than because of implicit government support.",
Edward Lazear,58,Stanford,m,8,8,Agree,Agree,Changes in U.S. gasoline prices over the past 10 years have predominantly been due to market factors rather than U.S. federal economic or energy policies.,Govt policy that affects supply feeds into market prices over the long run. Short run variations are almost completely unrelated to govt.
Edward Lazear,59,Stanford,m,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment.",Estimates used by CEA of the effect of complete free trade are as large as $500 billion per year - enormous even if off by a scalar.

Edward Lazear,61,Stanford,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Because the U.S. Treasury bailed out and backstopped banks (by injecting equity into them in late 2008, and later committing to provide public capital to any banks that failed the stress tests and could not raise private capital), the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would have been without these measures.",
Edward Lazear,62,Stanford,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Loosening current licensing restrictions on the range of services that nurses, physician assistants, dental hygienists and pharmacists are permitted to perform would help patients on balance, because the additional safety risks would be small compared to the decreased costs in waiting time and fees.",

Some contribute far more to shareholder value than their pay."
Edward Lazear,68,Stanford,m,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: Mandating that U.S. publicly listed corporations must allow shareholders to cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation was a good idea.,Mandates are not necessary. Potential shareholders do not have to own shares in companies whose corp gov is not to their liking.
Edward Lazear,69,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,One of the leading reasons for rising U.S. income inequality over the past three decades is that technological change has affected workers with some skill sets differently than others.,The distribution has spread out at all relevant deciles. The question that remains is why the skill gap is not closing.
Edward Lazear,70,Stanford,m,6,8,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question A: If the US replaced its discretionary monetary policy regime with a gold standard, defining a ""dollar"" as a specific number of ounces of gold, the price-stability and employment outcomes would be better for the average American.",The gold standard adds credibility when a country lacks discipline.The cost is monetary polic flexibility. The tradeoff is unclear in US.
Edward Lazear,71,Stanford,m,8,9,Agree,Strongly Agree,Question B: There are many factors besides US inflation risk that influence the current dollar price of gold.,This is a market like any other. The supply of gold and other sources of demand affect its price in real terms relative to other goods.
Edward Lazear,72,Stanford,m,9,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, using more congestion charges in crowded transportation networks — such as higher tolls during peak travel times in cities, and peak fees for airplane takeoff and landing slots — and using the proceeds to lower other taxes would make citizens on average better off.","The failure to price things like time results in overuse.

Edward Lazear,73,Stanford,m,6,8,Disagree,Strongly Agree,A tax on the carbon content of fuels would be a less expensive way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions than would a collection of policies such as “corporate average fuel economy” requirements for automobiles.,This compares two ineffective approaches. The magnitude of this problem is so great that no sufficient carbon tax is feasible worldwide.
Edward Lazear,74,Stanford,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, making drugs illegal raises street prices for those drugs because suppliers require extra compensation for the risk of incarceration and other punishments.",Quantities also adjust because of the effect on demand but the supply price is higher when drugs are illegal.
Edward Lazear,75,Stanford,m,5,5,Uncertain,Agree,Question B: The Netherlands restrictions on “soft drugs” combined with a moderate tax aimed at deterring their consumption would have lower social costs than continuing to prohibit use of those drugs as in the US. (Click here for a summary of the Netherlands restrictions.),Two issues confound this. The effect of lower prices and more availability on the young and drug tourism.
Edward Lazear,76,Stanford,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question A: Credible assumptions for inflation, GDP growth and primary budget deficits in Italy imply that either the Debt-to-GDP ratio in Italy would increase sharply if Italian interest rates on 10-year government debt remained at the November 30 level of around 7 percent or Italy would lose access to the bond market.",

Edward Lazear,80,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Eliminating tax deductions for non-investment personal interest expenses (e.g., on mortgages), with reductions in personal tax rates that are both budget neutral and keep the burden of taxes by income group the same, would lead to more efficient financing decisions by individuals.",More important than financing choice is likely the excess of housing investment relative to other investment that would be reduced.
Edward Lazear,81,Stanford,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Reducing the deductibility of interest expenses for non-financial businesses to equalize the overall tax cost of debt and equity financing, while using the extra revenue to reduce personal and corporate tax rates in a budget neutral fashion that also keeps the burden of taxes the same, would lead to more efficient financing decisions by firms.",This is the standard issue of subsidizing debt financing over equity financing and the proposal moves in the right direction.

Judith Chevalier,262,Yale,f,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,There are other important reasons too.
Judith Chevalier,263,Yale,f,2,7,Agree,Agree,"If the fiscal changes that are planned under current US law take place next year — including Bush era tax cuts expiring, Medicare payment rates to doctors being cut, the AMT applying to many more taxpayers, and automatic cuts in defense and non-defense discretionary spending kicking in — then US real GDP growth in 2013 will be lower than it would be under the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, in which the above changes do not occur.","This is the debate.

Judith Chevalier,279,Yale,f,7,6,Agree,Agree,"Because the U.S. Treasury bailed out and backstopped banks (by injecting equity into them in late 2008, and later committing to provide public capital to any banks that failed the stress tests and could not raise private capital), the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would have been without these measures.",
Judith Chevalier,280,Yale,f,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Loosening current licensing restrictions on the range of services that nurses, physician assistants, dental hygienists and pharmacists are permitted to perform would help patients on balance, because the additional safety risks would be small compared to the decreased costs in waiting time and fees.",There is some evidence on these issues; there is less study of this than one might hope.
Judith Chevalier,281,Yale,f,10,5,Agree,Agree,"Bans on the short selling of financial securities, such as stocks and government bonds, lead to prices that are further, on average, from their fundamental values.","I would have said strongly, but there may be instances where one could use other securities to synthesize or mimic the short."

Judith Chevalier,290,Yale,f,9,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, using more congestion charges in crowded transportation networks — such as higher tolls during peak travel times in cities, and peak fees for airplane takeoff and landing slots — and using the proceeds to lower other taxes would make citizens on average better off.","In general, the theory for pricing of congestion externalities would be analogous to pricing other externalities."
Judith Chevalier,291,Yale,f,9,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,A tax on the carbon content of fuels would be a less expensive way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions than would a collection of policies such as “corporate average fuel economy” requirements for automobiles.,That is not to suggest that a carbon cap and trade program is necessarily worse than a tax. But CAFE worse.

Judith Chevalier,295,Yale,f,2,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Absent outside help to deal with runs, such as a pledge of fiscal support from Germany or an unlimited commitment by the ECB to buy bonds, there is no spending-and-tax plan Italy can announce that would be credible enough to hold its interest rates low enough to stabilize its Debt-to-GDP ratio.","Again, this is definitely not my area, and I might have preferred the question to include a ""likely"", but I believe it is likely to be true."

Kenneth Judd,6,Stanford,m,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: Replacing the current US health insurance system as outlined in a) would lead to lower aggregate innovation in the pharmaceutical industry.,The rate of innovation is determined by many factors unrelated to profits. The policy in a) certainly would not help.

I believe there are better ways to help them."
Kenneth Judd,9,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: Replacing the current US health insurance system as outlined in a) would lead to longer waiting times for healthcare for a meaningful subset of the population.,Some forms of rationing would have to be used and queuing times is one likely result.
Kenneth Judd,10,Stanford,m,6,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: Following the UK election result, the certainty that the country is going to leave the European Union will provide a substantial short-term boost to the UK economy.",I doubt that any benefit would be substantial.
Kenneth Judd,11,Stanford,m,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: The near certainty that the UK will leave the European Union’s customs union and single market in 2020 offers a sizeable export market opportunity for American business.,The UK is not large enough for there to be a sizable effect.
Kenneth Judd,12,Stanford,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,A ban on very short-term loans at very high annualized interest rates (aka payday lending) would make most people who use or might use them better off.,"I generally favor allowing voluntary transactions, but I suspect that demand is usually driven by behavior inconsistent with rationality."
Kenneth Judd,13,Stanford,m,10,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Under current policies on climate change, the associated physical risks (such as those arising from total seasonal rainfall and sea level changes, and increased frequency, severity, and correlation of extreme weather events) will be at most a very small factor in monetary policy decisions over the next decade.",Monetary policy is based on data that is aggregated over space and time. Weather events will have very small impact on that data.
Kenneth Judd,14,Stanford,m,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: The physical risks associated with climate change under current policies are likely to threaten financial stability over the next decade.,"If financial stability is threatened by more bad weather, then we are in deep trouble when it comes to handling the explosion in debt."
Kenneth Judd,15,Stanford,m,3,4,Agree,Uncertain,"Taking into account the revenues, consumer surplus, purchasing patterns by income, and possible consumer biases, state-run lotteries (such as Powerball and scratch-off games) increase social welfare.",Lotteries were oversold when introduced but there is a demand for this product and little evidence that consumers are involuntarily harmed.
Kenneth Judd,16,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Strongly Agree,Question A: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for answering some long unsettled questions in development economics research.,"Well-constructed experiments are informative. However, one must avoid excessive generalization and extrapolation."
Kenneth Judd,17,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for making significant progress in poverty reduction.,Policies for reducing poverty must be based on a long-run perspective. Experiments that also have a long-run focus can be valuable.
Kenneth Judd,18,Stanford,m,9,6,Agree,Agree,Question A: Rising inequality is straining the health of liberal democracy.,"Political power often comes with wealth. The ideal is ""one person, one vote"". ""One dollar, one vote"" is not democracy."
Kenneth Judd,19,Stanford,m,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: Enacting more redistributive expenditures and policies would be likely to limit the rise of populism.,"Trump's ""populist"" policy included a reduction in corporate taxation, which will increase inequality. Populists don't seem to care."
Kenneth Judd,20,Stanford,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question C:
Governments should allocate more resources to policies that would be likely to limit the rise of populism, even if it means higher public debt or lower public spending in other areas.",Government should focus on doing its job in providing education and safety. Populism is partly based on a view that government is not.
Kenneth Judd,21,Stanford,m,6,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Having companies run to maximize shareholder value creates significant negative externalities for workers and communities.,This depends on the regulatory environment. IF laws impose the proper constraints THEN maximizing value will not create externalities.
Kenneth Judd,22,Stanford,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Appropriately managed corporations could create significantly greater value than they currently do for a range of stakeholders – including workers, suppliers, customers and community members – with negligible impacts on shareholder value.","In light of the current litigation regarding opioids, it is clear that things could be improved."
Kenneth Judd,23,Stanford,m,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,Question C: Effective mechanisms for boards of directors to ensure that CEOs act in ways that balance the interests of all stakeholders would be straightforward to introduce.,"There is nothing ""straightforward"" about creating such mechanisms."

Kenneth Judd,26,Stanford,m,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: Fining companies above a certain size that fail to provide the same remuneration to men and women employees performing comparable roles would be an effective way of closing the gender pay gap.,"Define ""comparable roles."" If two jobs perform the same task, but one offers much more flexibility in hours, then a wage difference is fine."
Kenneth Judd,27,Stanford,m,8,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Mexico's persistent bilateral trade surplus with the United States implies that Mexico is following policies that keep the peso artificially weak against the US dollar.,"Bilateral trade balances mean nothing. I run a very large trade deficit with Safeway, Apple, Walgreens, and many other entities. So what?"
Kenneth Judd,28,Stanford,m,9,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: The existence of a multi-year trade deficit of Country A with Country B implies that B has successfully tilted the playing field in its favor in terms of such policies as tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and the exchange rate between them.",
Kenneth Judd,29,Stanford,m,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,Question A: The first required class for undergraduate economics majors at my university accurately reflects the way that economists think about a range of economics problems.,I have no idea what they teach.

Kenneth Judd,31,Stanford,m,7,6,Agree,Agree,Question A: The incidence of the latest round of US import tariffs is likely to fall primarily on American households.,
Kenneth Judd,32,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: The impact of the tariffs – and any Chinese countermeasures – on US prices and employment is likely to be felt most heavily by lower income groups and regions.,
Kenneth Judd,33,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Selecting candidates for membership of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) based primarily on their political views would lead to worse monetary policy outcomes than has been the case over the last 15 years.,
Kenneth Judd,34,Stanford,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,Question A: The admission of children of alumni and donors at elite private colleges and universities crowds out applicants with greater academic potential.,I doubt that lower quality students would be crowded out.
Kenneth Judd,35,Stanford,m,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: The net effect of admitting children of alumni and donors (including any impact on donations and any losses of other high potential applicants) is likely to be a reduction in the contribution of colleges and universities to society.,"Given (a), the phrase ""at elite private colleges"" is implicit here. This then embraces the usual insult that other colleges are not as good."
Kenneth Judd,36,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,Question A: Senator Warren’s proposed wealth tax would be much more difficult to enforce than existing federal taxes because of difficulties of valuation and the ways by which the wealthy can under-report their true wealth.,
Kenneth Judd,37,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,"Question B: If successfully enforced, Senator Warren’s proposed wealth tax would substantially decrease the share of wealth going to the top 0.1% of wealth-holders after 20 years.",
Kenneth Judd,38,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question C: A public policy goal that could be accomplished with a well-enforced wealth tax could be equally accomplished with modifications to existing federal taxes – for example, revising the estate tax and/or capital gains tax.",
Kenneth Judd,39,Stanford,m,8,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: Forcing Amazon to divest Whole Foods now would be in the public interest.,On what grounds? What illegal actions have Amazon taken?
Kenneth Judd,40,Stanford,m,9,5,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: Acquisitions by large tech platforms where there are risks of anti-competitive effects like those posed by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods should not be permitted.,"A guy leaves a bar and drives away, he may be drunk and kill someone. ""Risk"" does not justify stopping him. A stronger argument is needed."
Kenneth Judd,41,Stanford,m,8,5,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Question C: Large tech platforms, such as Amazon Marketplace and Google Search, should be designated as ‘platform utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform.","I have seen no reason why such s strong measure is needed instead of rational, fact-based regulation."
Kenneth Judd,42,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Countries that borrow in their own currency should not worry about government deficits because they can always create money to finance their debt.,A government may be able to do this once but doing this systematically will make it impossible to sell bonds in the future.
Kenneth Judd,43,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question B: Countries that borrow in their own currency can finance as much real government spending as they want by creating money.,"Friedman wrote a book ""There's No Such Thing As a Free Lunch."" He also meant road or bridge or army or school or ANYTHING!"
Kenneth Judd,44,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: When local governments compete by offering subsidies to a firm that is willing to relocate, and shopping across multiple alternative areas, the firm typically captures most of value that is created via the relocation.","In a competition for a once-in-a-decade opportunity, the firm will get most of the benefits. Remember Foxconn -- WI beat ILL but will lose."
Kenneth Judd,45,Stanford,m,8,4,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: A federal prohibition against states and municipalities offering tax subsidies to attract specific businesses that are shopping across multiple areas to relocate would be welfare improving for the average taxpayer.,"How can a law define ""shopping""? Cities subsidize stadiums because the team MIGHT get offers. Better to fix municipal bond tax rules."
Kenneth Judd,46,Stanford,m,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,"It is best for society if the management of U.S. publicly traded corporations only considers the impact of their decisions on customers, employees, and community members to the extent that these impacts feedback to impact shareholder wealth.",I doubt that the shareholder maximizing efforts of the makers of OxyContin was good for society.
Kenneth Judd,47,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, absent any inside information, an equity investor can expect to do better by holding a well-diversified, low-fee, passive index fund than by holding a few stocks.",This follows from basic statistics for risk averse investors. May fail with Friedman-Savage or similar utility not supported by data.
Kenneth Judd,48,Stanford,m,8,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Raising the top federal marginal tax on earned personal income to 70% (and holding the rest of the current tax code, including the top bracket definition, fixed) would raise substantially more revenue (federal and state, combined) without lowering economic activity.","Revenue may be higher, but the impact on output would be substantial. E.g., many will convert earned income to perks or capital gains."
Kenneth Judd,49,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Rather than using second-round runoffs to settle elections in which no candidate wins a first-round majority, it would be better to use ranked-choice voting (as in the state of Maine) in which voters are encouraged to rank all of the candidates.",This gives each voter more flexibility in describing their preferences.
Kenneth Judd,50,Stanford,m,3,6,Agree,Agree,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).",
Kenneth Judd,51,Stanford,m,9,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Considering a broad range of costs and benefits is a better tool for guiding climate policy than setting temperature limits (such as 1.5 °C , eg) based on expected links between temperature increases and the extent of environmental harm.",A temperature target is an inflexible goal and not responsive to tradeoffs that are part of any policy decision.
Kenneth Judd,52,Stanford,m,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: Carbon taxes are a better way to implement climate policy than cap-and-trade.,"A carbon tax imposes a uniform carbon price across all emissions. How do you cap my car's annual CO2 emissions? Also, we need the revenue."

Kenneth Judd,55,Stanford,m,7,6,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: Capping the number of ride-sharing drivers as is being discussed in New York City, Chicago and London will make the average resident in that city worse off.",Congestion is a serious problem in the center of these cities. Caps would help alleviate congestion.
Kenneth Judd,56,Stanford,m,8,7,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: To achieve a given level of congestion, it would be better to use taxes for driving that vary based on the level of congestion, rather than limiting the number of ride-sharing vehicles.","Pricing based on congestion is far better than a cap which reduces cars at all times, even when congestion is low."
Kenneth Judd,57,Stanford,m,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Because global supply chains are more important now, import tariffs are likely substantially more costly than they would have been 25 years ago.",Diamond-Mirrlees result: thou shalt not tax intermediate goods.

Kenneth Judd,67,Stanford,m,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"The biggest reason for the measured slowdown in US productivity growth since the mid-2000s is that productivity increases have gone mismeasured, including new and better products and services that have been insufficiently captured by real output data.",Mismeasurement has always been a problem.

Kenneth Judd,72,Stanford,m,10,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Without changes in policy, a rising share of people who are over age 65 will exert a substantial downward influence on per capita real GDP in western European countries.",Productivity declines with age.

Young could lose if labor market frictions are not fixed.
Kenneth Judd,74,Stanford,m,7,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: The concept of “maximum sustainable employment” is well defined enough to be used beneficially in economic policymaking.,The traditional measurement is unemployment rate. The ratio of employment to population depends on demographics as much as economic health.

Kenneth Judd,114,Stanford,m,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: The four largest domestic US banks currently have around 40% of the industry’s domestic assets (an average of 10% each).

Thirty years ago, before interstate branching was fully permitted, that combined share was around 8% (an average of 2% each).
Capping US banks’ size so that no single bank could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets would lower systemic risk in the US.",My worry is that most banks pursue similar business strategies. Many banks doing risky things is no safer than a few banks doing the same.

Kenneth Judd,221,Stanford,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question B: Comparing two plans that would reduce federal budget deficits by identical amounts in each of the next 10 years, one that did so partly by reducing significantly the long-term growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid spending would do more to make the U.S. budget fiscally sustainable than one that did not lower the growth of these spending programs.",
Kenneth Judd,222,Stanford,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,Question A: Taking into account all of the economic consequences — including the incentives of banks to ensure their own liquidity and solvency in the future — the benefits of bailing out U.S. banks in 2008 will end up exceeding the costs.,
Kenneth Judd,223,Stanford,m,5,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Because GM and Chrysler were bailed out in 2008-09, the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would it have been if Congress and the executive branch had not intervened.",
Kenneth Judd,224,Stanford,m,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,Question C: Taking into account all of the economic consequences — including effects on corporate managers' incentives and on creditors' expectations of how their claims will be treated in future bankruptcies — the benefits of bailing out GM and Chrysler will end up exceeding the costs.,
Kenneth Judd,225,Stanford,m,6,6,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: The U.S government should make further efforts to shrink the size of the country's largest banks — such as by capping the size of their liabilities or penalizing large banks more heavily through taxes or other means — because the existing regulations do not require the biggest banks to internalize enough of the ""too-big-to-fail"" risks that they pose.","Banks face the same market incentives, and will make similar investments. Penalizing size does not help the solvency of the banking system."
Kenneth Judd,226,Stanford,m,7,5,Disagree,Agree,Question B: The economic benefits to the U.S. of having a handful of banks with balance sheets greater than $1 trillion are small.,If size helps a bank provide significantly better service to customers then the economy enjoys significant benefits.
Kenneth Judd,227,Stanford,m,8,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Question A: The federal government would make the average U.S. citizen better off by using policies that directly focus more on increasing manufacturing employment than employment in other sectors.,"The average American benefits from lower prices, not from any preference for manufacturing."
Kenneth Judd,228,Stanford,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Because firms and inventors do not capture the full returns from research and development, the government would increase the average well-being of Americans (and potentially of others too) by favoring R&D using the tax code.",The relatively small cost of R&D subsidies is an effective way to support continued high American productivity.
Kenneth Judd,229,Stanford,m,6,6,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: Consider one of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that President Obama enacted in the Affordable Care Act — reducing Medicare-related payments to private insurers and altering the payment system for doctors and hospitals — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because over time the supply of doctors, hospitals and insurers willing to offer them health services may decline in response to restrained payments.","These payments come from a bargaining process. When too high, Medicare pushes them down. If there is exit, Medicare will allow them to rise."
Kenneth Judd,230,Stanford,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Consider the other of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that Governor Romney advocates — giving future seniors a fixed payment for premiums and letting private insurers compete with Medicare — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because competition may not be powerful to enough to offer future seniors the same quality of care that is currently promised without supplementing their premium support.",Insurance companies will spend money to attract healthy people and push others to Medicare.
Kenneth Judd,231,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Claims by incumbent presidents and challengers about how many private-sector jobs can be created in a four-year period by sector-level or other targeted policies should be viewed as rough guesses, because overall macroeconomic conditions drive aggregate employment in ways that dominate any net effects of polices that focus on specific industries or households.",
Kenneth Judd,232,Stanford,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: One drawback of taxing capital income at a lower rate than labor income is that it gives people incentives to relabel income that policymakers find hard to categorize as ""capital"" rather than labor"".",

Kenneth Judd,234,Stanford,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Although they do not always agree about the precise likely effects of different tax policies, another reason why economists often give disparate advice on tax policy is because they hold differing views about choices between raising average prosperity and redistributing income.",

Kenneth Judd,246,Stanford,m,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: Loans to students attending for-profit colleges are especially risky because students attending them have had default rates that greatly exceed those for comparable students attending public and non-profit private institutions.,Perhaps these students were high default risks no matter what schools they attended. Cannot infer causation from correlation.

Kenneth Judd,262,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,Productivity growth will be slow as long as we use current methods. This could change drastically if we move to online modes of instruction.

Larry Samuelson,21,Yale,m,1,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Having companies run to maximize shareholder value creates significant negative externalities for workers and communities.,"Companies can clearly create externalities, but a general characterization of their sign and magnitude is less clear."
Larry Samuelson,22,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Appropriately managed corporations could create significantly greater value than they currently do for a range of stakeholders – including workers, suppliers, customers and community members – with negligible impacts on shareholder value.",Appropriate actions could impose second-order losses on shareholders while attaining first-order gains for others.
Larry Samuelson,23,Yale,m,5,6,Agree,Disagree,Question C: Effective mechanisms for boards of directors to ensure that CEOs act in ways that balance the interests of all stakeholders would be straightforward to introduce.,Anticipating the unintended consequences of incentives is always difficult.
Larry Samuelson,24,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Agree,"A substantial source of the value of decentralized private cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, arises from their convenience for use in illegal activities.","One fears that bitcoin is ideally suited for illegal activities, and there is anecdotal evidence, but we do not have precise measurements."
Larry Samuelson,25,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: In a case like the US women’s national soccer team where the revenues that they generate and their on-field performance both exceed those of the men’s team, there is no justification for lower pay.","It's a normative judgement, but commonly accepted standards for evaluating pay do not justify a differential."
Larry Samuelson,26,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: Fining companies above a certain size that fail to provide the same remuneration to men and women employees performing comparable roles would be an effective way of closing the gender pay gap.,"Too much lies in the details, such as what would comprise ""comparable roles"" and how this is to be implemented, to evalutae this proposal."
Larry Samuelson,27,Yale,m,8,8,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Mexico's persistent bilateral trade surplus with the United States implies that Mexico is following policies that keep the peso artificially weak against the US dollar.,There is no reason to expect bilateral trade balances to match; a surplus may reflect many factors other than an artificially weak currency.
Larry Samuelson,28,Yale,m,8,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: The existence of a multi-year trade deficit of Country A with Country B implies that B has successfully tilted the playing field in its favor in terms of such policies as tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and the exchange rate between them.",
Larry Samuelson,29,Yale,m,10,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: The first required class for undergraduate economics majors at my university accurately reflects the way that economists think about a range of economics problems.,
Larry Samuelson,30,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: The first required class for undergraduate economics majors at my university addresses the most pressing economic issues in the US.,i believe that every introductory economics class has room for improvement in this respect.
Larry Samuelson,31,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,Question A: The incidence of the latest round of US import tariffs is likely to fall primarily on American households.,"Retaliation raises the very real prospect that American business will also bear a significant burden. Typically, no one wins a trade war."
Larry Samuelson,32,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: The impact of the tariffs – and any Chinese countermeasures – on US prices and employment is likely to be felt most heavily by lower income groups and regions.,Those with higher incomes will be better able to adjust to the tariff-induced distortions.
Larry Samuelson,33,Yale,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Selecting candidates for membership of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) based primarily on their political views would lead to worse monetary policy outcomes than has been the case over the last 15 years.,The Fed derives its strength from its apolitical nature. A politicized Fed will not be nearly as effective.
Larry Samuelson,34,Yale,m,6,6,Disagree,Agree,Question A: The admission of children of alumni and donors at elite private colleges and universities crowds out applicants with greater academic potential.,"Even legacies must meet standards, and cases in which unqualified students are admitted are sufficiently few as to have little effect."
Larry Samuelson,35,Yale,m,6,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: The net effect of admitting children of alumni and donors (including any impact on donations and any losses of other high potential applicants) is likely to be a reduction in the contribution of colleges and universities to society.,
Larry Samuelson,36,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,Question A: Senator Warren’s proposed wealth tax would be much more difficult to enforce than existing federal taxes because of difficulties of valuation and the ways by which the wealthy can under-report their true wealth.,Wealth is notoriously difficult to tax. Enforcement problems are compounded by the distortions induced by legal tax evasion.
Larry Samuelson,37,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,"Question B: If successfully enforced, Senator Warren’s proposed wealth tax would substantially decrease the share of wealth going to the top 0.1% of wealth-holders after 20 years.","If successful, taxation at rates of two or three percent, compounded over twenty years, would significantly diminish the taxed wealth."
Larry Samuelson,38,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question C: A public policy goal that could be accomplished with a well-enforced wealth tax could be equally accomplished with modifications to existing federal taxes – for example, revising the estate tax and/or capital gains tax.",
Larry Samuelson,39,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Disagree,Question A: Forcing Amazon to divest Whole Foods now would be in the public interest.,
Larry Samuelson,40,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: Acquisitions by large tech platforms where there are risks of anti-competitive effects like those posed by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods should not be permitted.,
Larry Samuelson,41,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Disagree,"Question C: Large tech platforms, such as Amazon Marketplace and Google Search, should be designated as ‘platform utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform.","Technology has created a new type of ""natural monopoly"" that calls for a new understanding and a new competition policy."
Larry Samuelson,42,Yale,m,6,8,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Countries that borrow in their own currency should not worry about government deficits because they can always create money to finance their debt.,"Deficits can be financed by creating money, but still have disadvantages as well as advantages that should be carefully considered."
Larry Samuelson,43,Yale,m,6,8,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question B: Countries that borrow in their own currency can finance as much real government spending as they want by creating money.,"Creating money can finance a great deal of spending, but incidents of hyperinflation, collapse and other crises indicate there are limits."
Larry Samuelson,44,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: When local governments compete by offering subsidies to a firm that is willing to relocate, and shopping across multiple alternative areas, the firm typically captures most of value that is created via the relocation.",
Larry Samuelson,45,Yale,m,8,4,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: A federal prohibition against states and municipalities offering tax subsidies to attract specific businesses that are shopping across multiple areas to relocate would be welfare improving for the average taxpayer.,
Larry Samuelson,46,Yale,m,6,7,Disagree,Disagree,"It is best for society if the management of U.S. publicly traded corporations only considers the impact of their decisions on customers, employees, and community members to the extent that these impacts feedback to impact shareholder wealth.","Maximizing shareholder wealth would be best for society in a perfect world, but externalities can cause interests to diverge."
Larry Samuelson,47,Yale,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, absent any inside information, an equity investor can expect to do better by holding a well-diversified, low-fee, passive index fund than by holding a few stocks.",
Larry Samuelson,48,Yale,m,6,6,Agree,Disagree,"Raising the top federal marginal tax on earned personal income to 70% (and holding the rest of the current tax code, including the top bracket definition, fixed) would raise substantially more revenue (federal and state, combined) without lowering economic activity.",Some increase in top rate would raise revenue with minimal effects on economic activity; it's less clear how high one could raise the rate.
Larry Samuelson,49,Yale,m,1,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Rather than using second-round runoffs to settle elections in which no candidate wins a first-round majority, it would be better to use ranked-choice voting (as in the state of Maine) in which voters are encouraged to rank all of the candidates.",We have too many voting impossibility theorems to state flatly that one method is better.
Larry Samuelson,50,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).",
Larry Samuelson,51,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Considering a broad range of costs and benefits is a better tool for guiding climate policy than setting temperature limits (such as 1.5 °C , eg) based on expected links between temperature increases and the extent of environmental harm.",Consideration of a broad range of costs and benefits should lie behind any policy. This may well lead to a temperature limit.
Larry Samuelson,52,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,Question B: Carbon taxes are a better way to implement climate policy than cap-and-trade.,"Cap and trade is a reasonably second-best, but a carbon tax is more flexible and potentially more effective."
Larry Samuelson,53,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Ideas are nonrival, so increasing returns to scale is an essential feature of technological change in a market economy.",The increasing returns created by nonrival ideas is perhaps the leading contender for explaining economic growth.
Larry Samuelson,54,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"If a small number of firms have a large combined market share in a properly defined market, it is strong evidence that those firms have substantial market power.","""Large combined market share"" is a crude and elusive measure, and is not definitive, but it provides does provide strong evidence."
Larry Samuelson,55,Yale,m,1,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Capping the number of ride-sharing drivers as is being discussed in New York City, Chicago and London will make the average resident in that city worse off.","Market caps often cause sufficient distortions as to be detrimental, but in this case may also have beneficial implications for congestion."
Larry Samuelson,56,Yale,m,6,7,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: To achieve a given level of congestion, it would be better to use taxes for driving that vary based on the level of congestion, rather than limiting the number of ride-sharing vehicles.",Taxes are a much more flexible and subtle instrument than caps.
Larry Samuelson,57,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Because global supply chains are more important now, import tariffs are likely substantially more costly than they would have been 25 years ago.",
Larry Samuelson,58,Yale,m,10,7,Agree,Agree,"Britain's Labour party recently proposed giving the Bank of England a target of 3% annual labor productivity growth. Consider the following statement:

Central banks cannot significantly increase productivity growth over a ten year horizon, except perhaps by promoting macroeconomic stability.","Productivity growth is primarily a technological phenomenon, with monetary policy playing a secondary role."
Larry Samuelson,59,Yale,m,4,4,Disagree,Disagree,"The European Union often uses its antitrust powers to protect EU-based firms from international competition, rather than to promote greater competition in European markets.","I am not certain, but view EU antitrust policy as sometimes protecting European firms, and often promoting competition."
Larry Samuelson,60,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"All things considered, US society will be better off if sports betting becomes legal in more US states (beyond Nevada).","It may be easier to regulate and address the health effects of legal than illegal gambling, but overall impact of legalization is uncertain."
Larry Samuelson,61,Yale,m,6,4,Agree,Uncertain,"Over the next decade, autonomous cars will raise average welfare in the US by at least as much as smartphones have over the past decade.","A decade may be optimistic, but autonomous vehicles promise productivity gains, and (alas) perhaps also serious implications for inequality."
Larry Samuelson,62,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Disagree,Restricting eligibility for senior government economic-policy posts by requiring a graduate degree in economics would reduce the chances for good public policy outcomes.,"Meant Disagree, misread direction of question: “Econ PhD isn’t only desirable attribute, but helps if sr econ policy maker to has training.”"
Larry Samuelson,63,Yale,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"NCAA Division I schools coordinate compensation for men’s basketball and football players (precluding actual pay and limiting non-monetary benefits), providing rents to member schools (which may be shared with others) at the expense of those players.",
Larry Samuelson,64,Yale,m,10,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Imposing new US tariffs on steel and aluminum will improve Americans’ welfare.,"A small number of people, engaged in steel and aluminum production, will benefit from these tariffs, at great cost to many others."
Larry Samuelson,65,Yale,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: By providing electronic benefit cards to choose and buy groceries at stores, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program currently does more for its recipients' well-being than it would if the program directly provided a smaller array of foods to its recipients, while commensurately reducing the amount they could spend on groceries of their own choosing.","Despite stereotypes of the incompetent poor, there is little reason to believe the government is a more efficient shopper than are people."
Larry Samuelson,66,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Agree,"Question B: By providing electronic benefit cards to choose and buy groceries at stores, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program currently does more to raise food security and reduce hunger than it would if the program directly provided a smaller array of foods to its recipients, while commensurately reducing the amount they could spend on groceries of their own choosing.","Adding a procurement-and-distribution system to SNAP would increase costs, without obviously making the program more effective."
Larry Samuelson,67,Yale,m,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,"The biggest reason for the measured slowdown in US productivity growth since the mid-2000s is that productivity increases have gone mismeasured, including new and better products and services that have been insufficiently captured by real output data.","Mismeasurement is a factor, but there are others, such as an aging population, climate change, resources for homeland security, and war."
Larry Samuelson,68,Yale,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,"Because of the many special and unique roles that the dollar plays in global commerce, US citizens are substantially better off than they otherwise would be.",The faith n the US economy that drives the central role of the dollar in the international economy if one of our great assets.
Larry Samuelson,69,Yale,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,"Over the past two years, all else equal, the appeal of the US as a destination for immigrants has changed in ways that will likely decrease innovation in the US economy.","A great asset of the US, though lately diminished, has been the ability to attract the best minds from throughout the world."
Larry Samuelson,70,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: A bitcoin has a fundamental value of at least $1,000.","Unlike assets such as stocks that are backed by substantive economic activity, I see no way to define a ""fundamental value"" for bitcoin."
Larry Samuelson,71,Yale,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: The best forecast for the value of one bitcoin in 2 years is its current price.,But the current value is such a noisy forecast as to be of virtually no use.
Larry Samuelson,72,Yale,m,10,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Without changes in policy, a rising share of people who are over age 65 will exert a substantial downward influence on per capita real GDP in western European countries.","This is one reason we can expect economic growth rates to be sluggish in the near future, irrespective of economic policy."
Larry Samuelson,73,Yale,m,10,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: In European countries where the share of those over 65 is rising, there are net social benefits to adjusting retirement ages for state-financed (including pay-as-you-go) pension systems upwards, so that revised retirement ages better reflect longer life expectancies.",Adjusting ages to reflect increases in longevity is an obvious component of entitlement reform.
Larry Samuelson,74,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: The concept of “maximum sustainable employment” is well defined enough to be used beneficially in economic policymaking.,"Coming to a precise numbers is always difficult, but the concept is quite useful in thinking about our economy."
Larry Samuelson,75,Yale,m,6,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: Right now the US economy is operating below maximum sustainable employment.,"We might aspire to a higher labor force participation rate, but there is little evidence we can push the unemployment rates markedly lower."
Larry Samuelson,76,Yale,m,8,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Question A: If the US enacts a tax bill similar to those currently moving through the House and Senate — and assuming no other changes in tax or spending policy — US GDP will be substantially higher a decade from now than under the status quo.,Other factors swamp the importance of details of the tax code in determining GDP.
Larry Samuelson,77,Yale,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: If the US enacts a tax bill similar to those currently moving through the House and Senate — and assuming no other changes in tax or spending policy — the US debt-to-GDP ratio will be substantially higher a decade from now than under the status quo.,"The prospect of 5% GDP growth is absurdly unrealistic, and in its absence everyone agrees the proposed tax reform will contribute to debt."
Larry Samuelson,78,Yale,m,6,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Amending the Constitution to require that the federal government end each fiscal year without a deficit would substantially reduce output variability in the United States.,"Requiring budget balance would upend current operating procedure, with effects too uncertain to predict reduced output variability."
Larry Samuelson,79,Yale,m,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Amending the Constitution to require that the federal government end each fiscal year without a deficit would substantially lower the cost of borrowing for the federal government.,"Excessive debt can drive up borrowing costs, but it is not clear that current costs are vastly higher than they would be with budget balance"
Larry Samuelson,80,Yale,m,6,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Insights from psychology about individual behavior – examples of which include limited rationality, low self-control, or a taste for fairness – predict several important types of observed market outcomes that fully-rational economic models do not.","Insights from psychology are important, but fully rational models still exhibit an unparalleled mix of parsimony and predictive power."
Larry Samuelson,81,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,The influx of refugees into Germany beginning in the summer of 2015 will generate net economic benefits for German citizens over the succeeding decade.,"Europe is aging, and so an influx of young people is potentially valuable, but much depends on how effectively they are integrated."
Larry Samuelson,82,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Holding labor market institutions and job training fixed, rising use of robots and artificial intelligence is likely to increase substantially the number of workers in advanced countries who are unemployed for long periods.","But with appropriate institutions and retraining, the effect on unemployment could be significantly mitigated."
Larry Samuelson,83,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Rising use of robots and artificial intelligence in advanced countries is likely to create benefits large enough that they could be used to compensate those workers who are substantially negatively affected for their lost wages.,It is (alas) by no means clear that we can muster the political will to make the appropriate compensations.
Larry Samuelson,84,Yale,m,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: If the Fed changed its inflation target from 2% to 4%, the long-run costs of inflation for households would be essentially unchanged.","If the target change leads to higher inflation (otherwise, why raise the target?), then households will bear the attendant costs."
Larry Samuelson,85,Yale,m,6,5,Disagree,Agree,Question B: Raising the inflation target to 4% would make it possible for the Fed to lower rates by a greater amount in a future recession.,"We've already seen rates go as low as they can, so a higher inflation target opens up little room for lower rates."
Larry Samuelson,86,Yale,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"If the US reduced its fiscal deficit, then its trade deficit would also shrink.","There are so many variables at work here, including how the deficit is reduced, to be sure of the effect."
Larry Samuelson,87,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: The US should increase spending now on roads, railways, bridges and airports (including new projects, maintenance or both).",
Larry Samuelson,88,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Disagree,"Question B: The advisability of increasing federal spending on roads, railways, bridges and airports is independent of whether the US also enacts tax cuts that substantially lower revenues.","It would be a superb investment to finance infrastructure with tax revenue, but the investments are imperative regardless of tax policy."
Larry Samuelson,89,Yale,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Because labor markets across different sectors are connected, rising productivity in manufacturing leads the cost of labor-intensive services — such as education and health care — to rise.","One sees clear evidence in a variety of labor-intensive services -- education, health care, professional orchestras, and so on."
Larry Samuelson,90,Yale,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Since 1980, whenever substantial growth effects have been required to make a tax reform plan revenue neutral, the actual outcome has invariably been a fall in tax revenue as a share of GDP.","Cutting taxes can stimulate growth, but typically not by enough to increase total revenue collected."
Larry Samuelson,91,Yale,m,8,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question B: The tax reform plan proposed by President Trump this week would likely pay for itself through higher economic growth.,
Larry Samuelson,92,Yale,m,1,4,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: Implementing a ""destination based cash flow tax (including border adjustment)"" of the type advocated by Speaker Ryan would substantially reduce the US trade deficit within the next few years.","There are too many unknowns, including the reactions of other countries, to have any confidence that this would reduce the deficit."
Larry Samuelson,93,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Disagree,Question B: Implementing a “destination based cash flow tax (including border adjustment)” of the type advocated by Speaker Ryan would substantially raise prices for US consumers.,"Whatever the effect on the deficit, it is likely to have adverse effects on domestic prices."
Larry Samuelson,94,Yale,m,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Forecasting the effects of complex legislative actions is hard, so even competent, non-ideological and non-partisan projections could differ substantially from outcomes.",

Larry Samuelson,97,Yale,m,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: If the US significantly lowers the number of H-1B visas now, employment for American workers will rise materially over the next four years.","H-1B visa holders fill positions that are hard to fill domestically for structural reasons, such as skill mismatches."
Larry Samuelson,98,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,Providing state and local subsidies to build stadiums for professional sports teams is likely to cost the relevant taxpayers more than any local economic benefits that are generated.,"Common estimates of the benefits are often wildly inflated, and fail to distinguish total economic activity form net gains in activities."
Larry Samuelson,99,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,Question A: US share prices have risen since Donald Trump’s election victory at least partly because the policies he seems poised to implement are likely to increase US after-tax corporate profits.,"There is too much uncertainty about his policies to know for sure, but they appear to auger well for corporate profits."
Larry Samuelson,100,Yale,m,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: US share prices have risen since Donald Trump’s election victory at least partly because the policies he seems poised to implement are likely to increase US real GDP growth.,"Despite bold claims about growth, the new administration has not described an effective policy to increase GDP growth."
Larry Samuelson,101,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,The Council of Economic Advisors is likely to give the US president better policy advice if the Chair and Members of the CEA have published peer-reviewed economics research.,"Peer reviewed research is not the only source of insight, but it is an essential input, and the CEA is the obvious place to provide it."
Larry Samuelson,102,Yale,m,6,6,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question A: If all of the “Seven actions to protect American workers” in President-elect Trump’s 100-day plan (see link) are enacted, it will more likely than not improve the economic prospects of middle-class Americans over the next decade.","The proposals are too vague to assess with any confidence, but the seeming isolationist theme is not encouraging."
Larry Samuelson,103,Yale,m,6,6,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: If all of the “Seven actions to protect American workers” in President-elect Trump’s 100-day plan are enacted, it will more likely than not improve the economic prospects of low-skilled Americans over the next decade.","As before, the proposals are too vague to assess with confidence, but have an apparent isolationist theme that is not encouraging."

Larry Samuelson,105,Yale,m,8,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Long run fiscal sustainability in the US will require some combination of cuts in currently promised Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits and/or tax increases that include higher taxes on households with incomes below $250,000.",
Larry Samuelson,106,Yale,m,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Adding new or higher import duties on products such as air conditioners, cars, and cookies — to encourage producers to make them in the US — would be a good idea.","There are more effective policies to achieve the goals, such as increased employment, typically associated with import duties."
Larry Samuelson,107,Yale,m,5,6,Agree,Agree,Question A: Allowing US-based employers to hire many more immigrants with advanced degrees in science or engineering would lower (at least temporarily) the premium earned by current American workers with similar degrees.,"One would expect a temporary decrease in the premium, but it is not obvious that the effect would be significant or long-lasting."
Larry Samuelson,108,Yale,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: Allowing US-based employers to hire many more immigrants with advanced degrees in science or engineering would raise per capita income in the US over time.,The ability to bring the best and the brightest from throughout the world to our economy is a great resource.
Larry Samuelson,109,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because of the Brexit vote's outcome, the UK's real per-capita income level is likely to be lower a decade from now.","The European Union has various structural problems, but exiting will lead to efficiency losses and to lower per capital income in the UK."

Larry Samuelson,111,Yale,m,1,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Granting every American citizen over 21-years old a universal basic income of $13,000 a year — financed by eliminating all transfer programs (including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, housing subsidies, household welfare payments, and farm and corporate subsidies) — would be a better policy than the status quo.","There is much to recommend a universal basic income, but specifically a 13k income while ending all other transfers is difficult to assess."
Larry Samuelson,112,Yale,m,1,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,The ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile of the US income distribution has been unaffected by the Federal Reserve's unconventional monetary policies since the financial crisis.,"Fed policy may have had an effect, but this is swamped by the effects of other government policies and structural changes in the economy."
Larry Samuelson,113,Yale,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,The “Cadillac tax” on expensive employer-provided health insurance plans will reduce costly distortions in US health care if it is allowed to take effect as scheduled in 2018.,"Even better would be to divorce the provision of health care from employment entirely, but that is probably not a realistic possibility."
Larry Samuelson,114,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: The four largest domestic US banks currently have around 40% of the industry’s domestic assets (an average of 10% each). In early 1998, before Glass-Steagall ended and before Citicorp merged with Travelers, they held 13.2% (an average of 3.3% each). Thirty years ago, before interstate branching was fully permitted, that combined share was around 8% (an average of 2% each).
Capping US banks’ size so that no single bank could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets would lower systemic risk in the US.","Other alternatives, such as appropriately regulating reserves and leverage, would also be effective."
Larry Samuelson,115,Yale,m,6,4,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: The US financial system would contribute more to the average American's welfare if the size of US banks were capped so that none could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets.,
Larry Samuelson,116,Yale,m,8,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: By providing important measures of US economic performance — including employment, consumer prices, wages, job openings, time allocation in households, and productivity — the Bureau of Labor Statistics creates social benefits that exceed its annual cost of roughly $610 million.",One cannot hope to make effective economic policy without reliable data.
Larry Samuelson,117,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: Cuts in BLS spending would likely involve net social costs because potential declines in the quality of data, and thus their usefulness to researchers and decision makers, would exceed any budget savings.","Economic policy is often imprecise, but abandoning the data and making policy blindly would be even worse."
Larry Samuelson,118,Yale,m,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,An important reason why many workers in Michigan and Ohio have lost jobs in recent years is because US presidential administrations over the past 30 years have not been tough enough in trade negotiations.,Toughness in trade negotiations is considerably less important than factors such as skill-biased technical change in manufacturing.
Larry Samuelson,119,Yale,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: There is no perfect voting system. That is, no voting system can ensure that the winner will be the person who best represents voters’ wishes, including how intensely they favor or disfavor each candidate.",There is extensive research and impossibility results showing that there is no perfect voting system.
Larry Samuelson,120,Yale,m,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: One clear defect of a winner-take-all election with 3 or more candidates, and with each voter choosing only one candidate, is that a candidate who is strongly disliked by a majority, but strongly liked by a minority, can beat a candidate who is liked by a majority and disliked by relatively few.",Winner-take-all elections with multiple candidates are fertile ground for generating perverse results.

Larry Samuelson,124,Yale,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,"China’s growth model, specifically the unusually high investment rate and low consumption rate, is unsustainable.",China's growth numbers have long been suspect; it is remarkable that new evidence of their weakness has so much effect on world markets.
Larry Samuelson,125,Yale,m,10,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,"An annual December spending surge on parties, gift-giving and personal travel delivers net social benefits.","Despite curmudgeonly economics articles, the revealed preference is that people derive gains from these activities."
Larry Samuelson,126,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: The Fed should raise its target interest rate when it meets in mid-December.,"The conventional wisdom is that the strong November jobs report clinches a rate increase, and I see no reason to disagree."
Larry Samuelson,127,Yale,m,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: The Fed should have raised interest rates sooner, rather than leaving them near zero for this long.","Inflation has been surprising dormant, so there appear to have been few adverse consequences of prolonged low rates."
Larry Samuelson,128,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded US firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,"A year is still too short of a horizon to be confident that executives would appropriately weight long-term issues, which may span decades."
Larry Samuelson,129,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: A switch from quarterly to annual earnings reports would, on net, benefit shareholders.",The modest push toward better weighting of long-term issues must be balanced against the attendant loss of information and accountability.
Larry Samuelson,130,Yale,m,7,5,Agree,Agree,Comparing their students’ average gains on standardized tests over the school year makes it easier to predict which teachers — all else equal — are more likely to improve their student’s long-term life outcomes.,"But testing is just one of many measures, and is a noisy measure, and can induce distortions in behavior."
Larry Samuelson,131,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: The association between health and economic growth in poor countries primarily involves faster growth generating better health, rather than the other way around.","In some cases, health outcomes have improved without significant income growth, and it is difficult to say that the causality runs one way."
Larry Samuelson,132,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: The decline in the fraction of people with incomes under, say, $1 per day is a good measure of whether well-being is improving among low-income populations.","There are many other measures that should also be used, but this measure is informative."
Larry Samuelson,133,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Disagree,Question A: Expanding health insurance to more people through the ACA’s public subsidies and Medicaid expansion will reduce total healthcare spending in the economy.,Health care insurance should provide care more efficiently than the current lack of insurance coupled with reliance on emergency services.
Larry Samuelson,134,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,Question B: Expanding health insurance to more people through the ACA’s public subsidies and Medicaid expansion will generate gains in the health and well-being of the newly insured that exceed the costs.,"Basic medical care, especially preventative care, brings gains that are large compared to the costs."
Larry Samuelson,135,Yale,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: If the federal minimum wage is raised gradually to $15-per-hour by 2020, the employment rate for low-wage US workers will be substantially lower than it would be under the status quo.","Our elasticity estimates provide only local information about labor demand functions, giving little insight into such a large increase."
Larry Samuelson,136,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question B: Increasing the federal minimum wage gradually to $15-per-hour by 2020 would substantially increase aggregate output in the US economy.,
Larry Samuelson,137,Yale,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,The median Greek citizen will be better off if there is a “yes” vote in the July 5 referendum on whether to accept the terms of the bailout package offered by Greece's creditors.,"Voting no as a bargaining chip is not promising. There should be mutual gains from keeping Greece in the euro, if the will can be found."
Larry Samuelson,138,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Economic analysis can identify whether countries are using their exchange rates to benefit their own people at the expense of their trading partners’ welfare.,This is a difficult inference problem.
Larry Samuelson,139,Yale,m,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Bank of Japan monetary policies that result in a weaker yen make Americans generally worse off.,The weak yen gives rise to winners and losers in the US; it is not clear that the net effect (even if we could measure it) is negative.
Larry Samuelson,140,Yale,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Behavior in many complex and seemingly intractable strategic settings can be understood more clearly by working out what each party in the game will choose to do if they realize that the other parties will be solving the same problem. This insight has helped us understand behavior as diverse as military conflicts, price setting by competing firms and penalty kicking in soccer.",But one must be careful not to apply such equilibrium analysis in setting where it is not warranted.
Larry Samuelson,141,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"The 9% cumulative increase in real US median household income since 1980 substantially understates how much better off people in the median American household are now economically, compared with 35 years ago.","Yes, because it misses many innovations, but at the same time the upper end of the income distribution is extraordinarily better off."
Larry Samuelson,142,Yale,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Californians would be better off on average if all final users in the state paid the same price for water — adjusted for quality, place and time — even if, as a result, some food prices rose sharply and some farms failed.","""On average"" hides some serious adverse consequences for some people, but rationalizing water prices would be a great step forward."
Larry Samuelson,143,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,The Fed should wait until its preferred measure of inflation (Core PCE) is clearly rising — and not just forecast to rise — before it begins hiking interest rates.,"Other factors, such as unemployment and participation rates, should also enter the Fed's decision."
Larry Samuelson,144,Yale,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a city or state typically generates local benefits that outweigh the costs to the city and/or state providing the incentives.,"Benefits are wildly exaggerated in the popular press, and we lack definitive scientific evidence either way."
Larry Samuelson,145,Yale,m,8,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: The US as a whole benefits when cities or states compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,"Such competitive does enhance allocative efficiency, but its primary effect is to transfer surplus from other taxpayers to firms."
Larry Samuelson,146,Yale,m,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Declining to be vaccinated against contagious diseases such as measles imposes costs on other people, which is a negative externality.",
Larry Samuelson,147,Yale,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Considering the costs of restricting free choice, and the share of people in the US who choose not to vaccinate their children for measles, the social benefit of mandating measles vaccines for all Americans (except those with compelling medical reasons) would exceed the social cost.","But it would be quite reasonable to limit the negative externality imposed by the unvaccinated by, e.g., excluding them from public schools."
Larry Samuelson,148,Yale,m,3,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"In 10 years, per capita purchasing power in Greece will be higher if — rather than continuing to service its debts over the next decade and complying with the budget rules currently in place — it refuses to accept a continuation of its current troika program and explicitly defaults on its debt held by the official sector.",Greek economic institutions are notoriously ineffective; the troika program may provide the commitment needed to build working institutions.
Larry Samuelson,149,Yale,m,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Changing federal income tax rates, or the income bases to which those rates apply, can affect federal tax revenues partly by altering people’s behavior, and thus their actual or reported incomes.",
Larry Samuelson,150,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: To the extent that a given tax change might affect revenues partly by affecting national-income growth, existing research provides enough guidance to generate informative bounds on the size of any growth-driven revenue effect.","It's always difficult to turn qualitative predictions into precise estimates, but existing research can surely be helpful."
Larry Samuelson,151,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question C: For large proposed changes in tax rates or the tax base, official revenue forecasts provided to Congress would probably be more accurate if the CBO and JCT tried to estimate fully how the proposed tax changes would affect growth-driven revenue.","Behavioral responses will be most important for large changes, but the effects of large changes are particularly difficult to estimate."
Larry Samuelson,152,Yale,m,8,5,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Most college professors who assign textbooks would not be able to guess, within 10% of the actual figure, the retail price that their students pay for new copies of those books.",
Larry Samuelson,153,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Since students can resell college textbooks or rent electronic versions, the net burden on students is substantially lower than retail prices for new textbook purchases would suggest.","The net burden is lower than the retail price, but still scandalously high."
Larry Samuelson,154,Yale,m,11,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Question C:
Even though the professors who select textbooks are different form the people who pay for them, the price of new edition college textbooks reflect classic forces of supply and demand.",There are too many imperfections and frictions in this market to model it simply in terms of demand and supply.
Larry Samuelson,155,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,The recent decline in oil prices will promote higher real GDP in the US over the next couple of years.,"The decline in price is less significant than the technological progress in resource extraction it reflects, which should promote growth."
Larry Samuelson,156,Yale,m,9,6,Agree,Agree,A US city hosting a big convention will enjoy a higher boost to incremental spending — holding the number of visitors and their average incomes fixed — if those visitors are auto dealers rather than economists.,"We hate to be called the dismal science, but I fear we can be a dismal lot - or perhaps we work so hard there is no time to spend money."
Larry Samuelson,157,Yale,m,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,A typical country can increase its citizens’ welfare by enacting policies that would increase its trade surplus (or decrease its trade deficit).,"A surplus is often taken to indicate a healthy economy, but it is not obvious how producing more than it consume makes a country better off."
Larry Samuelson,158,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Disagree,Question A: Lowering the effective marginal tax rate on US corporations’ repatriated profits for a year would boost US capital investment significantly.,"""Significantly"" is always a difficult word."
Larry Samuelson,159,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Permanently lowering the effective marginal tax rate on US corporations’ repatriated profits, such as by moving to a territorial-based tax system, would boost US capital investment significantly.","Even better would be to have no corporate income tax and to have a sufficiently progressive consumption tax, but that's wishful thinking."
Larry Samuelson,160,Yale,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: By lowering bargaining costs, fast-track negotiating authority for the president makes it more likely that the U.S. can conclude major trade deals.","Without something like fast track, trade deals are notoriously difficult."
Larry Samuelson,161,Yale,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Past major trade deals have benefited most Americans.,"Unfortunately, benefitting most still leaves ample room for adverse effects for some."
Larry Samuelson,162,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question A: Amazon has monopsony power in the market for books that is significantly reducing the supply of books.,"Compared to no electronic market, Amazon has probably increased supply. Compared to a ""competitive electronic market,"" probably not."
Larry Samuelson,163,Yale,m,8,5,Agree,Disagree,"Question B:
Amazon has sufficient monopsony power that regulatory intervention is likely to make consumers of books better off, taking into account implementation costs and the effect of intervention on incentives.","Electronic markets are full of network externalities, which should be recognized as a form of natural monopoly."
Larry Samuelson,164,Yale,m,1,6,Uncertain,Disagree,The most powerful force pushing towards greater wealth inequality in the US since the 1970s is the gap between the after-tax return on capital and the economic growth rate.,"Many forces at work, both economic, social and political, making it difficult to identify one as most important."
Larry Samuelson,165,Yale,m,6,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Letting car services such as Uber or Lyft compete with taxi firms on equal footing regarding genuine safety and insurance requirements, but without restrictions on prices or routes, raises consumer welfare.","Consumer welfare may rise (though difficult to measure), but it will not be a Pareto improvement for consumers, making evaluation difficult."
Larry Samuelson,166,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Agree,"Although there are many issues for Scotland’s voters to consider, one consequence of separating from the rest of the UK would be greater macroeconomic instability for Scotland for many years.",This is unclear - pegging the Scottish to the English pound might essentially replicate the current state of affairs.
Larry Samuelson,167,Yale,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because the US has underspent on new projects, maintenance, or both, the federal government has an opportunity to increase average incomes by spending more on roads, railways, bridges and airports. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on May 23, 2013. Those earlier results can be found here.)",It would increase welfare; income is more difficult to assess.
Larry Samuelson,168,Yale,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Past experience of public spending and political economy suggests that if the government spent more on roads, railways, bridges and airports, many of the projects would have low or negative returns.

Larry Samuelson,169,Yale,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: By discounting pension liabilities at high interest rates under government accounting standards, many U.S. state and local governments understate their pension liabilities and the costs of providing pensions to public-sector workers.

Those earlier results can be found here.)","Unfortunately, current spending appears to trump properly funded pensions when it comes to seeking reelection."
Larry Samuelson,170,Yale,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: During the next two decades some U.S. states, unless they substantially increase taxes, cut spending, and/or change public-sector pensions, will require a combination of severe austerity budgets, a federal bailout, and/or default.

Larry Samuelson,171,Yale,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"New technology for fracking natural gas, by lowering energy costs in the United States, will make US industrial firms more cost competitive and thus significantly stimulate the growth of US merchandise exports.

(The experts panel previously voted on this question on February 15, 2012. Those earlier results can be found here.)",
Larry Samuelson,173,Yale,m,1,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: Taking into account all of the ARRA’s economic consequences — including the economic costs of raising taxes to pay for the spending, its effects on future spending, and any other likely future effects — the benefits of the stimulus will end up exceeding its costs. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on February 15, 2012. Those earlier results can be found here.)","This is too complicated a cost-benefit problem to assess. I think the ARRA was a good idea, but this reflects faith rather than analysis."
Larry Samuelson,174,Yale,m,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Legislation introduced in Congress would require the Federal Reserve to ""submit to the appropriate congressional committees…a Directive Policy Rule"", which shall ""describe the strategy or rule of the Federal Open Market Committee for the systematic quantitative adjustment of the Policy Instrument Target to respond to a change in the Intermediate Policy Inputs."" Should the Fed deviate from the rule, the Fed Chair would have to ""testify before the appropriate congressional committees as to why the [rule]…is not in compliance.""

Larry Samuelson,177,Yale,m,8,8,Agree,Agree,There is a social value to having institutions that issue liquid liabilities that are backed by illiquid assets.,"Such institutions can also impose social costs. If done well, the benefits outweigh the costs. The trick is to ensure this is the case."
Larry Samuelson,178,Yale,m,9,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Employers that discriminate in hiring will be at a competitive disadvantage, if their customers do not care about their mix of employees, compared with firms that do not discriminate.","It is an empirical question whether this disadvantage will overcome taste for discrimination, and whether markets will eliminate such firms."

Luigi Zingales,64,Chicago,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,

Maurice Obstfeld,118,Berkeley,m,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,"While some faculty salaries have risen faster than productivity, these make up a small fraction of total university operating costs."

Nancy Stokey,80,Chicago,f,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,The current trade barriers in the U.S. sugar industry raise the profits of sugar producers and make the typical U.S. consumer pay more for sugar and goods that use sugar as an input.,
Nancy Stokey,81,Chicago,f,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,Question A: Loans to students attending for-profit colleges are especially risky because students attending them have had default rates that greatly exceed those for comparable students attending public and non-profit private institutions.,

Nancy Stokey,88,Chicago,f,NA,5,No Opinion,Agree,"Consumers would not necessarily be better off if cable and satellite TV firms were required to offer a la carte pricing for individual channels, because the networks' programming charges and the satellite-and-cable fees could adjust in response to this rule.",

Nancy Stokey,114,Chicago,f,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Because the U.S. Treasury bailed out and backstopped banks (by injecting equity into them in late 2008, and later committing to provide public capital to any banks that failed the stress tests and could not raise private capital), the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would have been without these measures.",See Ch 7 of Friedman & Schwartz's Monetary History.

Oliver Hart,42,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Raising the top federal marginal tax on earned personal income to 70% (and holding the rest of the current tax code, including the top bracket definition, fixed) would raise substantially more revenue (federal and state, combined) without lowering economic activity.","Revenue would rise, but whether by a lot is unclear because there are many tax loop-holes. I would expect some small disincentive effects."
Oliver Hart,43,Harvard,m,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Rather than using second-round runoffs to settle elections in which no candidate wins a first-round majority, it would be better to use ranked-choice voting (as in the state of Maine) in which voters are encouraged to rank all of the candidates.","With a run-off, if there are several candidates, the ""wrong"" two may win the first round. This does not happen with a ranked system."
Oliver Hart,44,Harvard,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).",
Oliver Hart,45,Harvard,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Considering a broad range of costs and benefits is a better tool for guiding climate policy than setting temperature limits (such as 1.5 °C , eg) based on expected links between temperature increases and the extent of environmental harm.",
Oliver Hart,46,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,Question B: Carbon taxes are a better way to implement climate policy than cap-and-trade.,If we know the marginal cost of emissions a tax is better but if we know the optimal quantity cap and trade is better (see Weitzman).
Oliver Hart,47,Harvard,m,7,6,Agree,Agree,"Ideas are nonrival, so increasing returns to scale is an essential feature of technological change in a market economy.",An idea is non-rival and having one requires a large upfront cost (as in discovering the cure to a disease). Increasing returns follows.

Lower congestion could possibly overturn this."
Oliver Hart,50,Harvard,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: To achieve a given level of congestion, it would be better to use taxes for driving that vary based on the level of congestion, rather than limiting the number of ride-sharing vehicles.",Ordinary cars congest as much as ride-hailing cars.

Oliver Hart,61,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"The biggest reason for the measured slowdown in US productivity growth since the mid-2000s is that productivity increases have gone mismeasured, including new and better products and services that have been insufficiently captured by real output data.",It's a reason but I'm not sure that it is the biggest reason.
Oliver Hart,62,Harvard,m,5,6,Agree,Agree,"Because of the many special and unique roles that the dollar plays in global commerce, US citizens are substantially better off than they otherwise would be.","The U.S. government pays its debts and maintains low inflation. This is good for Americans. Sometimes a high dollar reduces exports,however."
Oliver Hart,63,Harvard,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Over the past two years, all else equal, the appeal of the US as a destination for immigrants has changed in ways that will likely decrease innovation in the US economy.",Immigrants contribute disproportionately to innovation.

Oliver Hart,68,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: The concept of “maximum sustainable employment” is well defined enough to be used beneficially in economic policymaking.,
Oliver Hart,69,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: Right now the US economy is operating below maximum sustainable employment.,
Oliver Hart,70,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,Question A: If the US enacts a tax bill similar to those currently moving through the House and Senate — and assuming no other changes in tax or spending policy — US GDP will be substantially higher a decade from now than under the status quo.,The incentive effects are unclear to me. Some of the simplifications make sense but many of the changes look like hand-outs to the rich.
Oliver Hart,71,Harvard,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: If the US enacts a tax bill similar to those currently moving through the House and Senate — and assuming no other changes in tax or spending policy — the US debt-to-GDP ratio will be substantially higher a decade from now than under the status quo.,It seems unlikely that the optimistic growth figures are correct and so the budget deficit will rise unless government cuts are made.
Oliver Hart,72,Harvard,m,10,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Amending the Constitution to require that the federal government end each fiscal year without a deficit would substantially reduce output variability in the United States.,Fiscal stimulus can be useful sometimes. Straight-jacketing the government is a mistake. Also I don't see how it would be enforced.
Oliver Hart,73,Harvard,m,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Amending the Constitution to require that the federal government end each fiscal year without a deficit would substantially lower the cost of borrowing for the federal government.,Suppose the government spends and borrows less. This might raise interest rates if consumers spend more to offset critical services.
Oliver Hart,74,Harvard,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Insights from psychology about individual behavior – examples of which include limited rationality, low self-control, or a taste for fairness – predict several important types of observed market outcomes that fully-rational economic models do not.",Real-world contracts are not as predicted by mechanism design theory. Employment contracts aren't that efficient. Fairness can explain this
Oliver Hart,75,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,The influx of refugees into Germany beginning in the summer of 2015 will generate net economic benefits for German citizens over the succeeding decade.,Refugees may provide labor that Germans can benefit from. But welfare transfers from Germans may be required. The net effect is ambiguous.
Oliver Hart,76,Harvard,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Holding labor market institutions and job training fixed, rising use of robots and artificial intelligence is likely to increase substantially the number of workers in advanced countries who are unemployed for long periods.","There will be jobs in health and care service.Workers will need training. Unemployment may rise initially, but maybe not long-term."
Oliver Hart,77,Harvard,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Rising use of robots and artificial intelligence in advanced countries is likely to create benefits large enough that they could be used to compensate those workers who are substantially negatively affected for their lost wages.,"The pie is bigger and so monetary compensation is possible. But people may lose self-esteem if they no longer have a""good"" job."
Oliver Hart,78,Harvard,m,5,5,Agree,Disagree,"Question A: If the Fed changed its inflation target from 2% to 4%, the long-run costs of inflation for households would be essentially unchanged.","I think that people can cope with low rates of inflation well, and 4% falls into that category. I wouldn't want to go much higher though."
Oliver Hart,79,Harvard,m,5,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: Raising the inflation target to 4% would make it possible for the Fed to lower rates by a greater amount in a future recession.,Nominal rates would be higher and so could be reduced without hitting the zero lower bound. Also real rates would be lower.
Oliver Hart,80,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"If the US reduced its fiscal deficit, then its trade deficit would also shrink.",It depends on how it is done. Taxes up? Government expenditure down? It is also possible to have a large trade deficit with fiscal balance.
Oliver Hart,81,Harvard,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: The US should increase spending now on roads, railways, bridges and airports (including new projects, maintenance or both).",U.S. infrastructure is in bad shape and fixing it can improve lives and provide the foundation for a stronger economy.
Oliver Hart,82,Harvard,m,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: The advisability of increasing federal spending on roads, railways, bridges and airports is independent of whether the US also enacts tax cuts that substantially lower revenues.","The budget deficit and national debt matter and so I would accompany infrastructure spending with higher taxes, particularly on the rich."
Oliver Hart,83,Harvard,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Because labor markets across different sectors are connected, rising productivity in manufacturing leads the cost of labor-intensive services — such as education and health care — to rise.","I expect the cost of education to rise relative to i-phones .Technology does make superstar teachers widely available, which offsets this."
Oliver Hart,84,Harvard,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Since 1980, whenever substantial growth effects have been required to make a tax reform plan revenue neutral, the actual outcome has invariably been a fall in tax revenue as a share of GDP.",iIf tax rates are very high reducing them can raise revenue as people work harder. But this has not been so recently:revenue has fallen.
Oliver Hart,85,Harvard,m,8,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question B: The tax reform plan proposed by President Trump this week would likely pay for itself through higher economic growth.,We do not have the details of the plan but it is very implausible that it would pay for itself.
Oliver Hart,86,Harvard,m,5,4,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: Implementing a ""destination based cash flow tax (including border adjustment)"" of the type advocated by Speaker Ryan would substantially reduce the US trade deficit within the next few years.",I don't know what the effects of a destination based tax would be or whether it would improve matters. I would prefer a consumption tax.
Oliver Hart,87,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question B: Implementing a “destination based cash flow tax (including border adjustment)” of the type advocated by Speaker Ryan would substantially raise prices for US consumers.,I don't know what the effects of a destination based tax would be or whether it would improve matters. I would prefer a consumption tax.
Oliver Hart,88,Harvard,m,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Forecasting the effects of complex legislative actions is hard, so even competent, non-ideological and non-partisan projections could differ substantially from outcomes.","The world is uncertain and even the most careful, conscientious, and skilled people may fail to anticipate some important factors."
Oliver Hart,89,Harvard,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Adjusting for legal restrictions on what the CBO can assume about future legislation and events, the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals.","The CBO is a serious and reputable agency. I would put a lot of weight on its forecasts, even knowing that some will inevitably be wrong."
Oliver Hart,90,Harvard,m,6,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: If the US significantly lowers the number of H-1B visas now, expected US tax revenues will rise materially over the next four years.","H-1B visa holders pay taxes and so there seems no direct effect. Wages might rise, raising taxes, but profits will fall, reducing them."
Oliver Hart,91,Harvard,m,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: If the US significantly lowers the number of H-1B visas now, employment for American workers will rise materially over the next four years.","There aren't that many H-1B visas. Also skilled workers may be complementary to other workers, and so the effect could go the other way."
Oliver Hart,92,Harvard,m,7,5,Agree,Agree,Providing state and local subsidies to build stadiums for professional sports teams is likely to cost the relevant taxpayers more than any local economic benefits that are generated.,The evidence suggests that expenditure by tourists is small and that locals who spend more on this sport spend less on other activities.
Oliver Hart,93,Harvard,m,10,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: US share prices have risen since Donald Trump’s election victory at least partly because the policies he seems poised to implement are likely to increase US after-tax corporate profits.,"People, probably correctly, expect lower corporate taxes and fewer regulations. Go figure."
Oliver Hart,94,Harvard,m,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: US share prices have risen since Donald Trump’s election victory at least partly because the policies he seems poised to implement are likely to increase US real GDP growth.,"I see no reason to think that growth will be higher because of Trump's policies, which are probably bad for the economy overall."
Oliver Hart,95,Harvard,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,The Council of Economic Advisors is likely to give the US president better policy advice if the Chair and Members of the CEA have published peer-reviewed economics research.,I would conjecture yes. Your advice will be better if you can understand the latest thinking and this is more likely if you publish.
Oliver Hart,96,Harvard,m,6,6,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question A: If all of the “Seven actions to protect American workers” in President-elect Trump’s 100-day plan (see link) are enacted, it will more likely than not improve the economic prospects of middle-class Americans over the next decade.",Many forces are responsible for middle-class people feeling left behind. These policies may make things worse by raising prices of imports.
Oliver Hart,97,Harvard,m,6,6,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: If all of the “Seven actions to protect American workers” in President-elect Trump’s 100-day plan are enacted, it will more likely than not improve the economic prospects of low-skilled Americans over the next decade.","Many forces are responsible for working-class people being left behind, including automation. It is hard to turn the clock back."
Oliver Hart,98,Harvard,m,7,4,Disagree,Disagree,A merger of AT&T and Time Warner would likely increase consumer surplus over the ensuing decade.,Possible but no reason to think it is likely It may not even be good for the two firms. The merged entity may have too much political power.
Oliver Hart,99,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Long run fiscal sustainability in the US will require some combination of cuts in currently promised Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits and/or tax increases that include higher taxes on households with incomes below $250,000.",It all depends on how much revenue can be raised by increasing taxes on those earning more than 250K. I don't know the answer to this.
Oliver Hart,100,Harvard,m,10,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Adding new or higher import duties on products such as air conditioners, cars, and cookies — to encourage producers to make them in the US — would be a good idea.",Duties lead to dead-weight losses and also retaliation.There can be losers from free trade but there are better ways to compensate them.
Oliver Hart,101,Harvard,m,7,6,Agree,Agree,Question A: Allowing US-based employers to hire many more immigrants with advanced degrees in science or engineering would lower (at least temporarily) the premium earned by current American workers with similar degrees.,"This seems very likely. The immigrants are chiefly substitutes for the US scientists. However, some might be complements, offsetting this."
Oliver Hart,102,Harvard,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Allowing US-based employers to hire many more immigrants with advanced degrees in science or engineering would raise per capita income in the US over time.,A simple free trade argument suggest that the U.S. would gain overall. The problem is that there may be losers as well as winners.
Oliver Hart,103,Harvard,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because of the Brexit vote's outcome, the UK's real per-capita income level is likely to be lower a decade from now.",A post-Brexit agreement between U.K. and E.U. is likely to involve trade barriers. This will reduce gains from trade. The U.K. will suffer.
Oliver Hart,104,Harvard,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Because of the Brexit vote's outcome, the rest of the EU's real per-capita income level is likely to be lower a decade from now.",Both sides gain from trade and so the EU will also suffer. The per capita loss is likely to be smaller simply because the EU is bigger.
Oliver Hart,105,Harvard,m,10,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Granting every American citizen over 21-years old a universal basic income of $13,000 a year — financed by eliminating all transfer programs (including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, housing subsidies, household welfare payments, and farm and corporate subsidies) — would be a better policy than the status quo.","Bill Gates would get 13K, which is crazy. Raising taxes is costly and so redistribution should be targeted to those who need help most."
Oliver Hart,106,Harvard,m,5,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,The ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile of the US income distribution has been unaffected by the Federal Reserve's unconventional monetary policies since the financial crisis.,"Quantitative easing has boosted asset prices, reduced interest rates and lowered unemployment. The overall effect on inequality is unclear."
Oliver Hart,107,Harvard,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,The “Cadillac tax” on expensive employer-provided health insurance plans will reduce costly distortions in US health care if it is allowed to take effect as scheduled in 2018.,"I think so. It would be better to count employer-based health insurance as taxable income, but the Cadillac tax is better than nothing."
Oliver Hart,108,Harvard,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: The four largest domestic US banks currently have around 40% of the industry’s domestic assets (an average of 10% each). In early 1998, before Glass-Steagall ended and before Citicorp merged with Travelers, they held 13.2% (an average of 3.3% each). Thirty years ago, before interstate branching was fully permitted, that combined share was around 8% (an average of 2% each).
Capping US banks’ size so that no single bank could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets would lower systemic risk in the US.",With banks being smaller no single bank's failure would lead to serious contagion or undermine the confidence of investors and depositors.
Oliver Hart,109,Harvard,m,5,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: The US financial system would contribute more to the average American's welfare if the size of US banks were capped so that none could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets.,There are benefits of large banks as well as costs. Regulation should include shadow banks and be more flexible than a cap on size.
Oliver Hart,110,Harvard,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: By providing important measures of US economic performance — including employment, consumer prices, wages, job openings, time allocation in households, and productivity — the Bureau of Labor Statistics creates social benefits that exceed its annual cost of roughly $610 million.","The BLS provides data, in an objective and neutral manner, that are essential for policy. Its benefits exceed its costs."
Oliver Hart,111,Harvard,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: Cuts in BLS spending would likely involve net social costs because potential declines in the quality of data, and thus their usefulness to researchers and decision makers, would exceed any budget savings.",Same answer as before.
Oliver Hart,112,Harvard,m,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,An important reason why many workers in Michigan and Ohio have lost jobs in recent years is because US presidential administrations over the past 30 years have not been tough enough in trade negotiations.,"Job losses occur because of automation, energy prices, tastes, as well as trade. A tougher policy could have been worse not better."
Oliver Hart,113,Harvard,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: There is no perfect voting system. That is, no voting system can ensure that the winner will be the person who best represents voters’ wishes, including how intensely they favor or disfavor each candidate.",We know from Arrow's impossibility theorem that no voting system can aggregate preferences perfectly even if people vote honestly.
Oliver Hart,114,Harvard,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: One clear defect of a winner-take-all election with 3 or more candidates, and with each voter choosing only one candidate, is that a candidate who is strongly disliked by a majority, but strongly liked by a minority, can beat a candidate who is liked by a majority and disliked by relatively few.","46% of people rank 3 candidates A,C,B. ( A first, B last.) 44% rank them B,C,A. 10% rank them C,B,A. Then A wins,but C may be better."
Oliver Hart,115,Harvard,m,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Large movements in monthly oil prices, either up or down, are driven primarily by speculators, as opposed to changes in the current (and planned) supply or demand for oil.","Prices may move frequently as speculators try to anticipate the future, but without speculation the movement would be larger when it occurs."
Oliver Hart,116,Harvard,m,7,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: If the UK opts to withdraw from the European Union, and assuming Scotland stays in the UK, the level of the UK's real per-capita income a decade later will be lower than if it remains part of the EU.","The EU is Britain's most important trade partner.

Oliver Hart,118,Harvard,m,6,6,Agree,Agree,"China’s growth model, specifically the unusually high investment rate and low consumption rate, is unsustainable.",As China becomes richer it will resemble other rich countries: growth rates will fall;wages and consumption will rise;investment will fall.
Oliver Hart,119,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,"An annual December spending surge on parties, gift-giving and personal travel delivers net social benefits.",There seems to be a social need for public celebrations and gifts. But some are forced to participate.The net benefit is unclear.
Oliver Hart,120,Harvard,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: The Fed should raise its target interest rate when it meets in mid-December.,I don't think so. The recovery is still weak and there are no serious signs of inflation. Also a little inflation may be good.
Oliver Hart,121,Harvard,m,5,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: The Fed should have raised interest rates sooner, rather than leaving them near zero for this long.",See answer to last question.
Oliver Hart,122,Harvard,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded US firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,I am in favor of letting firms do this but only if it is part of their charter or approved by shareholders. It should not be a blanket rule.
Oliver Hart,123,Harvard,m,10,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: A switch from quarterly to annual earnings reports would, on net, benefit shareholders.","For some firms it might be better, for others worse. This is not a case where one size fits all."
Oliver Hart,124,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Agree,Comparing their students’ average gains on standardized tests over the school year makes it easier to predict which teachers — all else equal — are more likely to improve their student’s long-term life outcomes.,Research by Chetty et al. suggests this is so and I take that seriously. But this is a complex issue and it is early to reach conclusions.
Oliver Hart,125,Harvard,m,8,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: The association between health and economic growth in poor countries primarily involves faster growth generating better health, rather than the other way around.",Better health can surely increase productivity and hence growth but it is hard to believe that the causation mainly goes this way.
Oliver Hart,126,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: The decline in the fraction of people with incomes under, say, $1 per day is a good measure of whether well-being is improving among low-income populations.",It is probably not a great measure unless it incorporates the prices of local goods. Also it misses out on non-traded goods and services.
Oliver Hart,127,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,Question A: Expanding health insurance to more people through the ACA’s public subsidies and Medicaid expansion will reduce total healthcare spending in the economy.,It could fall as people get more preventative care; or rise as people use doctors more. Some evidence suggests the latter but it's early.
Oliver Hart,128,Harvard,m,10,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: Expanding health insurance to more people through the ACA’s public subsidies and Medicaid expansion will generate gains in the health and well-being of the newly insured that exceed the costs.,ACA allows ill people to see doctors and provides peace of mind. Both would be negotiated behind the veil of ignorance. Net benefit>0.
Oliver Hart,129,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: If the federal minimum wage is raised gradually to $15-per-hour by 2020, the employment rate for low-wage US workers will be substantially lower than it would be under the status quo.",I worry that it will be but we don't know enough. Firms may raise prices and the Fed may accommodate some inflation. But the change is large
Oliver Hart,130,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question B: Increasing the federal minimum wage gradually to $15-per-hour by 2020 would substantially increase aggregate output in the US economy.,If employment not much affected and redistribution to workers demand could rise. But if sizable unemployment opposite could occur.
Oliver Hart,131,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,The median Greek citizen will be better off if there is a “yes” vote in the July 5 referendum on whether to accept the terms of the bailout package offered by Greece's creditors.,Yes means more of the same for Greece. No means a very uncertain future. But the Euro was a bad idea and should end as soon as possible.
Oliver Hart,132,Harvard,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: Economic analysis can identify whether countries are using their exchange rates to benefit their own people at the expense of their trading partners’ welfare.,"The answer depends on whether prices are flexible or sticky,the importance of foreign inputs in domestic goods. So hard to assess welfare."
Oliver Hart,133,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question B: Bank of Japan monetary policies that result in a weaker yen make Americans generally worse off.,Again it depends on whether prices are flexible or sticky. Also Americans benefit from cheaper Japanese goods. So hard to say.
Oliver Hart,134,Harvard,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Behavior in many complex and seemingly intractable strategic settings can be understood more clearly by working out what each party in the game will choose to do if they realize that the other parties will be solving the same problem. This insight has helped us understand behavior as diverse as military conflicts, price setting by competing firms and penalty kicking in soccer.",Nash equilibrium is enormously useful. But people can be less rational than the theory supposes and so the predictions may be misleading.
Oliver Hart,135,Harvard,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"The 9% cumulative increase in real US median household income since 1980 substantially understates how much better off people in the median American household are now economically, compared with 35 years ago.","Iphones weren't available then suggesting understatement. But both partners often work, which is stressful. This suggests overstatement."
Oliver Hart,136,Harvard,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Californians would be better off on average if all final users in the state paid the same price for water — adjusted for quality, place and time — even if, as a result, some food prices rose sharply and some farms failed.","Equal prices imply that all final users will value the last gallon they use the same, which ensures efficiency. Consumer rationing does not."
Oliver Hart,137,Harvard,m,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,The Fed should wait until its preferred measure of inflation (Core PCE) is clearly rising — and not just forecast to rise — before it begins hiking interest rates.,The recovery is anemic and I am more concerned that it will fizzle than I am worried about inflation. The Fed should not be too cautious.
Oliver Hart,138,Harvard,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a city or state typically generates local benefits that outweigh the costs to the city and/or state providing the incentives.,If it's done carefully--the firms can't get the tax benefits and then leave--this can pay off for a city or state.
Oliver Hart,139,Harvard,m,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: The US as a whole benefits when cities or states compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,There is no social benefit to the US as a whole unless the firms would have located abroad. There is a social loss from lower tax receipts.
Oliver Hart,140,Harvard,m,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Declining to be vaccinated against contagious diseases such as measles imposes costs on other people, which is a negative externality.",The science seems absolutely clear. If you are not vaccincated others are more likely to catch the disease ( as well as you).
Oliver Hart,141,Harvard,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Considering the costs of restricting free choice, and the share of people in the US who choose not to vaccinate their children for measles, the social benefit of mandating measles vaccines for all Americans (except those with compelling medical reasons) would exceed the social cost.",Another way to internalize the externality is to make those who don't get vaccinated pay a fine. But a mandate is adminstratively easier.
Oliver Hart,142,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"In 10 years, per capita purchasing power in Greece will be higher if — rather than continuing to service its debts over the next decade and complying with the budget rules currently in place — it refuses to accept a continuation of its current troika program and explicitly defaults on its debt held by the official sector.","For Greece: default is a plus,exclusion from the EU banking system is a minus- it could lead to bank runs and political chaos. Net unclear."
Oliver Hart,143,Harvard,m,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Changing federal income tax rates, or the income bases to which those rates apply, can affect federal tax revenues partly by altering people’s behavior, and thus their actual or reported incomes.",Consider an increase of income tax rates to 100%. Reported income would be close to zero after this.
Oliver Hart,144,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: To the extent that a given tax change might affect revenues partly by affecting national-income growth, existing research provides enough guidance to generate informative bounds on the size of any growth-driven revenue effect.",I doubt that we know enough. There are disagreements about the response of labor supply to moderate changes in income tax rates.
Oliver Hart,145,Harvard,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question C: For large proposed changes in tax rates or the tax base, official revenue forecasts provided to Congress would probably be more accurate if the CBO and JCT tried to estimate fully how the proposed tax changes would affect growth-driven revenue.",The estimates would not be perfect but they would be better than assuming no response.
Oliver Hart,146,Harvard,m,7,5,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Most college professors who assign textbooks would not be able to guess, within 10% of the actual figure, the retail price that their students pay for new copies of those books.","My guess is that most pick what they think is the best book (or, of course, their own book) without regard to price."
Oliver Hart,147,Harvard,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Since students can resell college textbooks or rent electronic versions, the net burden on students is substantially lower than retail prices for new textbook purchases would suggest.","This seems rather self-evident, although perhaps not all students can do this. Some people no doubt also photo-copy parts of books."
Oliver Hart,148,Harvard,m,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Question C:
Even though the professors who select textbooks are different form the people who pay for them, the price of new edition college textbooks reflect classic forces of supply and demand.",In some fields there will be a prominent book with few competitors. The author has some monopoly power; the equilibrium price may be high.
Oliver Hart,149,Harvard,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,The recent decline in oil prices will promote higher real GDP in the US over the next couple of years.,There are potentially confounding general equilibrium effects but the US as a net importer of oil should benefit from increased fracking.
Oliver Hart,150,Harvard,m,5,6,Agree,Agree,A US city hosting a big convention will enjoy a higher boost to incremental spending — holding the number of visitors and their average incomes fixed — if those visitors are auto dealers rather than economists.,Dealers have high-powered incentives. Winners may celebrate a lot and losers drown their sorrows. Low variance makes economists staid.
Oliver Hart,151,Harvard,m,10,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,A typical country can increase its citizens’ welfare by enacting policies that would increase its trade surplus (or decrease its trade deficit).,"A trade surplus means a country is saving, a trade deficit that it is dis-saving. As with people each can make sense at different times."
Oliver Hart,152,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question A: Lowering the effective marginal tax rate on US corporations’ repatriated profits for a year would boost US capital investment significantly.,The effects are hard to predict. US corporations might simply repatriate the profits and increase dividends or buy back shares.
Oliver Hart,153,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: Permanently lowering the effective marginal tax rate on US corporations’ repatriated profits, such as by moving to a territorial-based tax system, would boost US capital investment significantly.","US corporations might invest more abroad rather than at home. But comanies might issue equity rather than borrowing, which would be good."
Oliver Hart,154,Harvard,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: By lowering bargaining costs, fast-track negotiating authority for the president makes it more likely that the U.S. can conclude major trade deals.","If one party can make a take-it-or- leave-it offer to another party, a deal is often more likely than if bargaining occurs. But not always."
Oliver Hart,155,Harvard,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Past major trade deals have benefited most Americans.,Trade deals typically reduce barriers to trade which is likely to produce net gains to the U.S. ( although there can be winners and losers).
Oliver Hart,156,Harvard,m,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: Amazon has monopsony power in the market for books that is significantly reducing the supply of books.,Classic monopsonists reduce supply; final prices rise. This doesn't describe Amazon.I don't know evidence that book supply is lower.
Oliver Hart,157,Harvard,m,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B:
Amazon has sufficient monopsony power that regulatory intervention is likely to make consumers of books better off, taking into account implementation costs and the effect of intervention on incentives.",I don't see evidence that consumers and authors are suffering. The market is fast-moving. Regulators should monitor but be cautious.
Oliver Hart,158,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,The most powerful force pushing towards greater wealth inequality in the US since the 1970s is the gap between the after-tax return on capital and the economic growth rate.,"I would imagine there are many factors: labor-saving technology, globalization,the decline of unions,lower tax rates."
Oliver Hart,159,Harvard,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Letting car services such as Uber or Lyft compete with taxi firms on equal footing regarding genuine safety and insurance requirements, but without restrictions on prices or routes, raises consumer welfare.","I don't see any externalities. According to standard economics, competition enhances welfare and I believe that would be true here."
Oliver Hart,160,Harvard,m,7,5,Agree,Agree,"Although there are many issues for Scotland’s voters to consider, one consequence of separating from the rest of the UK would be greater macroeconomic instability for Scotland for many years.",The main uncertainty concerns whether Scotland retains the pound (bad idea) and stays in Europe( good idea). Once resolved things may be OK.
Oliver Hart,161,Harvard,m,10,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because the US has underspent on new projects, maintenance, or both, the federal government has an opportunity to increase average incomes by spending more on roads, railways, bridges and airports. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on May 23, 2013. Those earlier results can be found here.)",I would say increase average welfare rather than income. There are surely many potential projects where the social benefit exceeds cost.
Oliver Hart,162,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: Past experience of public spending and political economy suggests that if the government spent more on roads, railways, bridges and airports, many of the projects would have low or negative returns. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on May 23, 2013. Those earlier results can be found here.)",Perhaps sometimes true in the past but I don't think it's inevitable. Projects like the interstate highways are notable exceptions.
Oliver Hart,163,Harvard,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: By discounting pension liabilities at high interest rates under government accounting standards, many U.S. state and local governments understate their pension liabilities and the costs of providing pensions to public-sector workers. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on October 1, 2012. Those earlier results can be found here.)","Many plans are defined benefit. These promise certain benefits, which should be discounted at the riskless interest rate not a higher rate."
Oliver Hart,164,Harvard,m,5,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: During the next two decades some U.S. states, unless they substantially increase taxes, cut spending, and/or change public-sector pensions, will require a combination of severe austerity budgets, a federal bailout, and/or default. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on October 1, 2012. Those earlier results can be found here.)",Probably right. They should shift to defined contribution plans.
Oliver Hart,165,Harvard,m,2,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"New technology for fracking natural gas, by lowering energy costs in the United States, will make US industrial firms more cost competitive and thus significantly stimulate the growth of US merchandise exports. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on May 23, 2012. Those earlier results can be found here.)","I agree that energy cost should fall, which will increase U.S. competitiveness. The effects on growth are more subtle, and harder to predict"
Oliver Hart,166,Harvard,m,9,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would have been without the stimulus bill. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on February 15, 2012. Those earlier results can be found here.)",Given that wages/prices are sticky Keynesian-type stimulus will increase economic activity if the economy is not at full employment.
Oliver Hart,167,Harvard,m,9,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Taking into account all of the ARRA’s economic consequences — including the economic costs of raising taxes to pay for the spending, its effects on future spending, and any other likely future effects — the benefits of the stimulus will end up exceeding its costs. (The experts panel previously voted on this question on February 15, 2012. Those earlier results can be found here.)",Given that infrastructure expenditure was needed this was a good time to do it and so the benefits exceeded any costs.
Oliver Hart,168,Harvard,m,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Legislation introduced in Congress would require the Federal Reserve to ""submit to the appropriate congressional committees…a Directive Policy Rule"", which shall ""describe the strategy or rule of the Federal Open Market Committee for the systematic quantitative adjustment of the Policy Instrument Target to respond to a change in the Intermediate Policy Inputs."" Should the Fed deviate from the rule, the Fed Chair would have to ""testify before the appropriate congressional committees as to why the [rule]…is not in compliance."" Enacting this provision would improve monetary policy outcomes in the U.S.",No rules would have allowed the Fed to act appropriately in the recent crisis. Better to choose governors well and give them discretion.
Oliver Hart,169,Harvard,m,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: All else equal, Patent Assertion Entities — which specialize in acquiring and asserting patents and are popularly known as “patent trolls"" — promote innovation in the U.S.",If patents are correctly granted trolls can encourage innovation. if patents are incorrectly granted trolls can impede innovation.
Oliver Hart,170,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: Within the software industry, the US patent system makes consumers better off than they would be in the absence of patents.","Patents can encourage innovation. But many trivial software patents seem to be granted, which can discourage innovation and hurt consumers."
Oliver Hart,171,Harvard,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,There is a social value to having institutions that issue liquid liabilities that are backed by illiquid assets.,Consumers want liquid and safe securities. Firms' assets are often illiquid. Both sides can benefit if firms issue shares and senior debt.
Oliver Hart,172,Harvard,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Employers that discriminate in hiring will be at a competitive disadvantage, if their customers do not care about their mix of employees, compared with firms that do not discriminate.",They would earm more if they did not discriminate unless their other workers are prejudiced. But they may survive anyway if they earn rents.
Oliver Hart,173,Harvard,m,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: Rising market wages are an important reason — over and above any changes in medical technology, social norms or preferences — why family sizes have fallen over the past century in rich countries.","Ths substitution effect goes this way, but the income effect can go in the opposite direction: with more income you can afford more children"
Oliver Hart,174,Harvard,m,6,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Considering both distributional effects and changes in efficiency, it is a good idea to let companies that send video or other content to consumers pay more to Internet service providers for the right to send that traffic using faster or higher quality service.",Letting price vary with quality is good if there is enough competition. I don't know if that's true here. If not the answer is less clear.
Oliver Hart,175,Harvard,m,8,6,Disagree,Uncertain,The recent oversubscribed debt issues of Greece and Portugal suggest that sovereign default by any euro area country is unlikely in the foreseeable future.,"These econonomies still in bad shape.

Oliver Hart,177,Harvard,m,4,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Past experience suggests that economic sanctions do little to deter the target countries from their course of action.,"My sense is that economic sanctions were important in ending apartheid in South Africa, and are leading Iran to negotiate with the West."
Oliver Hart,178,Harvard,m,8,7,Agree,Uncertain,A market that allows payment for human kidneys should be established on a trial basis to help extend the lives of patients with kidney disease.,I'd like to see it but I'm not sure the public is ready.

Oliver Hart,181,Harvard,m,10,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Future innovations worldwide will not be transformational enough to promote sustained per-capita economic growth rates in the U.S. and western Europe over the next century as high as those over the past 150 years.,Economists are bad at predicting the far future. Technological advances have been amazing in the last few years and anything is possible.
Oliver Hart,182,Harvard,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Informed postmortems of Ben Bernanke’s Fed chairmanship will judge favorably the Fed's creative and aggressive policy initiatives from autumn 2008 through early 2009.,"A policy where the Fed let financial institutions go bankrupt or helped home-owners directly might have been better, but we will never know"
Oliver Hart,183,Harvard,m,10,8,Uncertain,Agree,"Using surge pricing to allocate transportation services — such as Uber does with its cars — raises consumer welfare through various potential channels, such as increasing the supply of those services, allocating them to people who desire them the most, and reducing search and queuing costs.",Consumer plus producer surplus should rise but in the absence of competition consumer surplus may not. With competition consumers will gain.
Oliver Hart,184,Harvard,m,10,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Giving specific presents as holiday gifts is inefficient, because recipients could satisfy their preferences much better with cash.",An assistant might prefer cash.

Pinelopi Goldberg,198,Yale,f,9,7,Agree,Agree,The current trade barriers in the U.S. sugar industry raise the profits of sugar producers and make the typical U.S. consumer pay more for sugar and goods that use sugar as an input.,
Pinelopi Goldberg,199,Yale,f,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,Question A: Loans to students attending for-profit colleges are especially risky because students attending them have had default rates that greatly exceed those for comparable students attending public and non-profit private institutions.,
Pinelopi Goldberg,200,Yale,f,1,5,Uncertain,Agree,Question B: Rules that tie each college's eligibility for federal student loans to its students' graduation rates and post-schooling employment outcomes would better protect taxpayers from losses on student loans.,Outcomes need to be measured. But graduation rates can be manipulated. Employment outcomes are a better criterion.
Pinelopi Goldberg,201,Yale,f,6,8,Agree,Agree,"Question A: The way in which money market funds normally trade – at one dollar per share, even though the per-share value of the assets backing them varies over time – made them vulnerable to a run in 2008 before they received taxpayer guarantees.",
Pinelopi Goldberg,202,Yale,f,6,7,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: Taxpayers would be better protected if each money market fund in the U.S. were instead required to trade at its floating net asset value.,

But Germany might be able to find alterntives in Asia or emerging Europe.

Pinelopi Goldberg,215,Yale,f,6,5,Disagree,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,"Increases in administrative overhead, expansion of facilities and rising health/pension costs have been more important."
Pinelopi Goldberg,216,Yale,f,6,7,Agree,Agree,"If the fiscal changes that are planned under current US law take place next year — including Bush era tax cuts expiring, Medicare payment rates to doctors being cut, the AMT applying to many more taxpayers, and automatic cuts in defense and non-defense discretionary spending kicking in — then US real GDP growth in 2013 will be lower than it would be under the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, in which the above changes do not occur.",Lower spending and higher taxes imply slower growth. But alternative scenario would lead to higher deficit.
Pinelopi Goldberg,217,Yale,f,5,5,Agree,Disagree,"New technology for fracking natural gas, by lowering energy costs in the United States, will make US industrial firms more cost competitive and thus significantly stimulate the growth of US merchandise exports.","Substantially lowering energy costs would make U.S. firms more competitive, but at a potentially veyr high environmental price."
Pinelopi Goldberg,218,Yale,f,1,6,Uncertain,Agree,Cuba’s low per-capita income growth — 1.2 percent per year since 1960 —has more to do with Cuba’s own economic policies than with the U.S. embargo on trade and tourism.,"Cuba's economic policies were flawed, but cutting off a small country from the rest of the world has detrimental effects on its growth."

The term ""unconscionably"" seems too loose - is it a 20% or 500% markup? But the goods need to be allocated somehow."
Pinelopi Goldberg,222,Yale,f,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"The former head of the Transportation Security Administration is correct in arguing that randomizing airport “security procedures encountered by passengers (additional upper-torso pat-downs, a thorough bag search, a swab test of carry-ons, etc.), while not subjecting everyone to the full gamut"" would make it ""much harder for terrorists to learn how to evade security procedures.""",Then why not send mutliple terrorists to a flight?

Pinelopi Goldberg,229,Yale,f,6,8,Agree,Agree,Changes in U.S. gasoline prices over the past 10 years have predominantly been due to market factors rather than U.S. federal economic or energy policies.,US domestic policy has only tiny effects on the world price of oil. US foreign policy is probably more relevant than energy policy.

However, short- and medium-run effects of NAFTA, especially on employment and wages in the US, unclear."
Pinelopi Goldberg,232,Yale,f,6,6,Agree,Agree,"Because the U.S. Treasury bailed out and backstopped banks (by injecting equity into them in late 2008, and later committing to provide public capital to any banks that failed the stress tests and could not raise private capital), the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would have been without these measures.","If the banking system had collapsed, unemployment would certainly have been higher in 2010."
Pinelopi Goldberg,233,Yale,f,NA,6,No Opinion,Agree,"Loosening current licensing restrictions on the range of services that nurses, physician assistants, dental hygienists and pharmacists are permitted to perform would help patients on balance, because the additional safety risks would be small compared to the decreased costs in waiting time and fees.","If licensing restrictions reflect training requirements, it is not clear that lowering training standards would be beneficial."

Thirty years ago, before interstate branching was fully permitted, that combined share was around 8% (an average of 2% each).
Capping US banks’ size so that no single bank could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets would lower systemic risk in the US.",

Like asking if 2+2=4.
Richard Thaler,120,Chicago,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: One clear defect of a winner-take-all election with 3 or more candidates, and with each voter choosing only one candidate, is that a candidate who is strongly disliked by a majority, but strongly liked by a minority, can beat a candidate who is liked by a majority and disliked by relatively few.","Yes, stuff can happen.

Richard Thaler,127,Chicago,m,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: The Fed should have raised interest rates sooner, rather than leaving them near zero for this long.",Congress gave them no choice. We should have been borrowing at negative r and building infrastructure. And no inflation in sight.
Richard Thaler,128,Chicago,m,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded US firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,Recent working paper says yes. http://bit.ly/1HgC0lg

Richard Thaler,140,Chicago,m,4,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Behavior in many complex and seemingly intractable strategic settings can be understood more clearly by working out what each party in the game will choose to do if they realize that the other parties will be solving the same problem.

Richard Thaler,143,Chicago,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,The Fed should wait until its preferred measure of inflation (Core PCE) is clearly rising — and not just forecast to rise — before it begins hiking interest rates.,Cost of waiting too long < cost of shooting too soon. Those predicting imminent inflation have been wrong for years.
Richard Thaler,144,Chicago,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a city or state typically generates local benefits that outweigh the costs to the city and/or state providing the incentives.,I don't see how anyone can have an opinion about this without data. A $1 tax break is worth it. $100B not. In between?
Richard Thaler,145,Chicago,m,1,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: The US as a whole benefits when cities or states compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,Again data would be nice.

True by definition.

Amazon has sufficient monopsony power that regulatory intervention is likely to make consumers of books better off, taking into account implementation costs and the effect of intervention on incentives.",Too vague to answer. What sort of regulation? By whom?
Richard Thaler,164,Chicago,m,NA,6,No Opinion,Disagree,The most powerful force pushing towards greater wealth inequality in the US since the 1970s is the gap between the after-tax return on capital and the economic growth rate.,A bug in the system prevents me from stating that I am 100% sure that I don't know the answer to this question.
Richard Thaler,165,Chicago,m,4,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Letting car services such as Uber or Lyft compete with taxi firms on equal footing regarding genuine safety and insurance requirements, but without restrictions on prices or routes, raises consumer welfare.","But Uber needs to be careful about surge pricing in emergencies, people care about fairness as much as efficiency."

Richard Thaler,194,Chicago,m,6,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Enactment of the Senate bill to subject the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and discount window decisions to an audit by the Comptroller General of the U.S. would improve the Fed's legitimacy without hurting its decision making.,

Richard Thaler,200,Chicago,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Conventional economic reasoning suggests that it would be a good policy to enact the recent Senate bill that would let undergraduate students borrow through the government Stafford program at interest rates equivalent to the primary credit rates offered to banks through the Federal Reserve's discount window.,Guessing what conventional economic reasoning suggests is not in my wheel house. Social returns to student loans is probably high.
Richard Thaler,201,Chicago,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,An effective way to increase savings rates of employees whose firms have defined contribution plans is to combine automatic enrollment in those plans and periodic automatic increases in their contributions (with the ability to opt out of either).,Finally a question which I am qualified to answer.
Richard Thaler,202,Chicago,m,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,Sustained tax and spending policies that boost consumption in ways that reduce the saving rate are likely to lower long-run living standards.,

Richard Thaler,207,Chicago,m,7,6,Agree,Agree,Reducing the income-tax deductibility of charitable gifts is a less distortionary way to raise new revenue than raising the same amount of revenue through a proportional increase in all marginal tax rates.,The current system stinks.

Richard Thaler,210,Chicago,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Refusing to liberalize trade unless partner countries adopt new labor or environmental rules is a bad policy, because even if the new standards would reduce distortions on some dimensions, such a policy involves threatening to maintain large distortions in the form of restricted trade.","Poor question.

Richard Thaler,213,Chicago,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: The distortionary costs of raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour and indexing it to inflation are sufficiently small compared with the benefits to low-skilled workers who can find employment that this would be a desirable policy.,All methods of helping the poor cause distortions. This one not bad.

Richard Thaler,216,Chicago,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Because all federal spending and taxes must be approved by both houses of Congress and the executive branch, a separate debt ceiling that has to be increased periodically creates unneeded uncertainty and can potentially lead to worse fiscal outcomes.",The debt ceiling is a dumb idea with no benefits and potentially catestrophic costs if ever used.
Richard Thaler,217,Chicago,m,4,6,Disagree,Disagree,The federal government would make the average U.S. citizen better off by using policies that directly focus more on increasing small business growth than growth of economic output overall.,Maybe I am missing something but I see no particular reason why this sector should be favored.
Richard Thaler,218,Chicago,m,1,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,The annual indexing of Social Security benefits to increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (the CPI-W) leads to higher benefits than would be required to compensate recipients for genuine cost-of-living increases.,Hard to say without knowing about healthcare costs.
Richard Thaler,219,Chicago,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"The Brookings Institution recently described a US carbon tax of $20 per ton, increasing at 4% per year, which would raise an estimated $150 billion per year in federal revenues over the next decade. Given the negative externalities created by carbon dioxide emissions, a federal carbon tax at this rate would involve fewer harmful net distortions to the US economy than a tax increase that generated the same revenue by raising marginal tax rates on labor income across the board.",Great on effiency but not on progressivity so you have to get that right elsewhere.
Richard Thaler,220,Chicago,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will continue to grow under current policy beyond the 10-year window of most political budget debates, it is easy for a politician to devise a budget plan that would reduce federal deficits over the next decade without really making the U.S. fiscally sustainable.",arithmetic
Richard Thaler,221,Chicago,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Comparing two plans that would reduce federal budget deficits by identical amounts in each of the next 10 years, one that did so partly by reducing significantly the long-term growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid spending would do more to make the U.S. budget fiscally sustainable than one that did not lower the growth of these spending programs.","ditto.

Richard Thaler,223,Chicago,m,7,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Because GM and Chrysler were bailed out in 2008-09, the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would it have been if Congress and the executive branch had not intervened.",There was no private money available.
Richard Thaler,224,Chicago,m,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,Question C: Taking into account all of the economic consequences — including effects on corporate managers' incentives and on creditors' expectations of how their claims will be treated in future bankruptcies — the benefits of bailing out GM and Chrysler will end up exceeding the costs.,
Richard Thaler,225,Chicago,m,5,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: The U.S government should make further efforts to shrink the size of the country's largest banks — such as by capping the size of their liabilities or penalizing large banks more heavily through taxes or other means — because the existing regulations do not require the biggest banks to internalize enough of the ""too-big-to-fail"" risks that they pose.",Seems right.

Would prefer lower tax rate and broader tax.
Richard Thaler,229,Chicago,m,3,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Consider one of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that President Obama enacted in the Affordable Care Act — reducing Medicare-related payments to private insurers and altering the payment system for doctors and hospitals — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because over time the supply of doctors, hospitals and insurers willing to offer them health services may decline in response to restrained payments.","Of course, there is no such thing as a risk free lunch."
Richard Thaler,230,Chicago,m,7,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Consider the other of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that Governor Romney advocates — giving future seniors a fixed payment for premiums and letting private insurers compete with Medicare — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because competition may not be powerful to enough to offer future seniors the same quality of care that is currently promised without supplementing their premium support.","This one is more substantive. It is like changing from an indexed DB plan to a nominal DC plan. Worse, adds risks that states default!"
Richard Thaler,231,Chicago,m,3,8,Agree,Agree,"Claims by incumbent presidents and challengers about how many private-sector jobs can be created in a four-year period by sector-level or other targeted policies should be viewed as rough guesses, because overall macroeconomic conditions drive aggregate employment in ways that dominate any net effects of polices that focus on specific industries or households.",Agree. More generally too much weight is given to the jobs numbers. How about if we evaluate a president by the return on the stock market
Richard Thaler,232,Chicago,m,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: One drawback of taxing capital income at a lower rate than labor income is that it gives people incentives to relabel income that policymakers find hard to categorize as ""capital"" rather than labor"".","See Romney, Mitt."
Richard Thaler,233,Chicago,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question B: Despite relabeling concerns, taxing capital income at a permanently lower rate than labor income would result in higher average long-term prosperity, relative to an alternative that generated the same amount of tax revenue by permanently taxing capital and labor income at equal rates instead.",If you tax investment income what will people do? Stuff their money in the mattress?
Richard Thaler,234,Chicago,m,4,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Although they do not always agree about the precise likely effects of different tax policies, another reason why economists often give disparate advice on tax policy is because they hold differing views about choices between raising average prosperity and redistributing income.",duh
Richard Thaler,235,Chicago,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: By discounting pension liabilities at high interest rates under government accounting standards, many U.S. state and local governments understate their pension liabilities and the costs of providing pensions to public-sector workers.",
Richard Thaler,236,Chicago,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: During the next two decades some U.S. states, unless they substantially increase taxes, cut spending, and/or change public-sector pensions, will require a combination of severe austerity budgets, a federal bailout, and/or default.","Why it is a terrible idea to shift the residual risk of Medicare costs to states, many of which are already in virtual default."
Richard Thaler,237,Chicago,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: Even if the third round of quantitative easing that the Fed recently announced increases real GDP growth over the next two years, the increase will be inconsequential.",don't know and will never know.

Richard Thaler,240,Chicago,m,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,Question A: Ethanol content requirements and protectionism against imported ethanol (which includes fuel from sugarcane) raise food prices without significantly reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.,The first half of the statement is surely true. I have no idea whether emissions are significantly reduced so can't answer the question.
Richard Thaler,241,Chicago,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: A direct disincentive to emit carbon-dioxide, for example through a carbon tax or an emissions permit market, is more efficient than requiring the use of corn-based ethanol fuels.",Of course we should have a carbon tax or the equivalent. Taxes with negative dead weight loss are good things!
Richard Thaler,242,Chicago,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,"Question A: Even if all the official-sector funding that Greece received from 2010 through August 2012 is written off, propping up Greece to buy time for the rest of Europe to prepare for Greek default has been better for citizens of the Eurozone outside of Greece than a policy that would have cut off funding sooner.",

Richard Thaler,245,Chicago,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,The current trade barriers in the U.S. sugar industry raise the profits of sugar producers and make the typical U.S. consumer pay more for sugar and goods that use sugar as an input.,uncle Sam as sugar daddy.
Richard Thaler,246,Chicago,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,Question A: Loans to students attending for-profit colleges are especially risky because students attending them have had default rates that greatly exceed those for comparable students attending public and non-profit private institutions.,Presumes facts that I do not know to be true.
Richard Thaler,247,Chicago,m,3,5,Uncertain,Agree,Question B: Rules that tie each college's eligibility for federal student loans to its students' graduation rates and post-schooling employment outcomes would better protect taxpayers from losses on student loans.,Hard to know without more details. The no brainer is to require better disclosure. You should have asked about that.
Richard Thaler,248,Chicago,m,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: The way in which money market funds normally trade – at one dollar per share, even though the per-share value of the assets backing them varies over time – made them vulnerable to a run in 2008 before they received taxpayer guarantees.",
Richard Thaler,249,Chicago,m,1,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: Taxpayers would be better protected if each money market fund in the U.S. were instead required to trade at its floating net asset value.,Not sure about this policy. Would be very confusing to investors who (wrongly) think of these as bank accounts rather than investments.
Richard Thaler,250,Chicago,m,3,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question C: In the absence of floating net asset values, taxpayers would be better protected if each money market fund in the U.S. were required to set aside capital to protect against losses while holding back a portion of shareholders' cash for a time when they seek to withdraw all of their money.",Seems like this could ENCOURAGE runs.
Richard Thaler,251,Chicago,m,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Taxes or bans on large bottles of soft drinks containing sugar are not likely to have a significant effect on obesity rates because people will substitute towards consuming excessive calories in other ways.,Bad question. Taxes unlikely to work if low but big cigarette takes reduce consumption and peoplle don't substitute other smoke!
Richard Thaler,252,Chicago,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,Subjecting online sales from out-of-state vendors to the same retail sales taxes imposed on in-state sales would raise more tax revenue in the states making this change while reducing the pro-online bias of current policy.,Seems right to level the playing field.
Richard Thaler,253,Chicago,m,8,5,Agree,Agree,"Consumers would not necessarily be better off if cable and satellite TV firms were required to offer a la carte pricing for individual channels, because the networks' programming charges and the satellite-and-cable fees could adjust in response to this rule.","Both prix fixe and a la carte have their place.

Richard Thaler,255,Chicago,m,NA,6,No Opinion,Disagree,"Question A: Assuming that Germany eventually agrees to backstop the debt of southern European countries, the eurozone as a whole will be better off if that bailout is unconditional, rather than accompanied by the labor market reforms and future budget controls that Germany is demanding of countries in return.",All these questions require better knowledge of details than I possess.

Richard Thaler,262,Chicago,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,Seems like this would vary a lot among fields.
Richard Thaler,263,Chicago,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"If the fiscal changes that are planned under current US law take place next year — including Bush era tax cuts expiring, Medicare payment rates to doctors being cut, the AMT applying to many more taxpayers, and automatic cuts in defense and non-defense discretionary spending kicking in — then US real GDP growth in 2013 will be lower than it would be under the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, in which the above changes do not occur.",No brainer.

Richard Thaler,291,Chicago,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,A tax on the carbon content of fuels would be a less expensive way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions than would a collection of policies such as “corporate average fuel economy” requirements for automobiles.,Since a carbon tax is politically infeasible how about hiking the gas tax by a dollar and then index it. We now have a negative carbon tax.
Richard Thaler,292,Chicago,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, making drugs illegal raises street prices for those drugs because suppliers require extra compensation for the risk of incarceration and other punishments.",A test of whether the panel is awake.
Richard Thaler,293,Chicago,m,10,5,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: The Netherlands restrictions on “soft drugs” combined with a moderate tax aimed at deterring their consumption would have lower social costs than continuing to prohibit use of those drugs as in the US. (Click here for a summary of the Netherlands restrictions.),War on drugs dumber than invading Iraq in search of WMDs. Treat pot like booze. Would also lower prison population.
Richard Thaler,294,Chicago,m,NA,6,No Opinion,Agree,"Question A: Credible assumptions for inflation, GDP growth and primary budget deficits in Italy imply that either the Debt-to-GDP ratio in Italy would increase sharply if Italian interest rates on 10-year government debt remained at the November 30 level of around 7 percent or Italy would lose access to the bond market.",

Richard Thaler,304,Chicago,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, permanently raising the federal marginal tax rate on ordinary income by 1 percentage point for those in the top (i.e., currently 35%) tax bracket would increase federal tax revenue over the next 10 years.",The Laffer curve should have stayed on the napkin.
Richard Thaler,305,Chicago,m,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: The cumulative budget shortfalls in the US over the next 10 years can be reduced by half (or more) purely by increasing the federal marginal tax rate on ordinary income for those in the top tax bracket.,Only a small part of the puzzle.

Prosperous people are better able to handle any economic change.
Robert Hall,33,Stanford,m,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,Selecting candidates for membership of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) based primarily on their political views would lead to worse monetary policy outcomes than has been the case over the last 15 years.,The obvious danger is an unwise monetary expansion timed to win an election.
Robert Hall,34,Stanford,m,8,6,Uncertain,Agree,Question A: The admission of children of alumni and donors at elite private colleges and universities crowds out applicants with greater academic potential.,"Total capacity of elite higher ed is endogenous, so a limit on favoritism to donors would cut capacity as well as allocating it to top kids."

Robert Hall,36,Stanford,m,5,5,Agree,Agree,Question A: Senator Warren’s proposed wealth tax would be much more difficult to enforce than existing federal taxes because of difficulties of valuation and the ways by which the wealthy can under-report their true wealth.,

Robert Hall,39,Stanford,m,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: Forcing Amazon to divest Whole Foods now would be in the public interest.,"Deciding would involve a serious analysis. There's a presumption against intervention, especially given WF's small share of the market."
Robert Hall,40,Stanford,m,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: Acquisitions by large tech platforms where there are risks of anti-competitive effects like those posed by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods should not be permitted.,"""Anti-competitive"" is a meaningless term. Policy on big platforms needs to be guided by serious consideration of social welfare."
Robert Hall,41,Stanford,m,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Question C: Large tech platforms, such as Amazon Marketplace and Google Search, should be designated as ‘platform utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform.","An analysis would require consideration of the incentives to create new dominant platforms, which would obviously be impaired by regulation."
Robert Hall,42,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question A: Countries that borrow in their own currency should not worry about government deficits because they can always create money to finance their debt.,"Governments cannot create money under current monetary institutions, because the central bank keeps reserves and currency at par"

Robert Hall,49,Stanford,m,9,7,Disagree,Agree,"Rather than using second-round runoffs to settle elections in which no candidate wins a first-round majority, it would be better to use ranked-choice voting (as in the state of Maine) in which voters are encouraged to rank all of the candidates.","Expert analysis finds no general superiority for instant runoffs.

Robert Hall,50,Stanford,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).","Talented and trained people make much higher incomes in the US than in Europe, and health care is human-capital intensive."

Robert Hall,114,Stanford,m,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: The four largest domestic US banks currently have around 40% of the industry’s domestic assets (an average of 10% each). In early 1998, before Glass-Steagall ended and before Citicorp merged with Travelers, they held 13.2% (an average of 3.3% each). Thirty years ago, before interstate branching was fully permitted, that combined share was around 8% (an average of 2% each).
Capping US banks’ size so that no single bank could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets would lower systemic risk in the US.","Systemic risk arises when speedy resolution of insolvency does not occur. With proper non-bailout resolution, big banks are fine."

That is, no voting system can ensure that the winner will be the person who best represents voters’ wishes, including how intensely they favor or disfavor each candidate.",This is well worked out theoretically. But it doesn't mean voting isn't better than the alternatives! (Answer by Andrew B. Hall)
Robert Hall,120,Stanford,m,9,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: One clear defect of a winner-take-all election with 3 or more candidates, and with each voter choosing only one candidate, is that a candidate who is strongly disliked by a majority, but strongly liked by a minority, can beat a candidate who is liked by a majority and disliked by relatively few.","Strategic voting should in principle help, but in practice coordination failures clearly do occur.

Robert Hall,126,Stanford,m,9,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: The Fed should raise its target interest rate when it meets in mid-December.,The Fed has somewhat overstated the current level of the natural unemployment rate and fails to understand that it is falling.
Robert Hall,127,Stanford,m,10,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: The Fed should have raised interest rates sooner, rather than leaving them near zero for this long.","The Fed's job is to stabilize inflation, barring significant inflationary shocks, and inflation continues to run below any reasonable target"
Robert Hall,128,Stanford,m,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded US firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,There's almost no support for short-term-ism. And earnings numbers themselves are unimportant. The market values overall prospects.
Robert Hall,129,Stanford,m,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question B: A switch from quarterly to annual earnings reports would, on net, benefit shareholders.",Public markets need certified disclosure regimes. Businesses that are harmed by disclosure should be private.
Robert Hall,130,Stanford,m,1,5,Agree,Agree,Comparing their students’ average gains on standardized tests over the school year makes it easier to predict which teachers — all else equal — are more likely to improve their student’s long-term life outcomes.,An heavily fact-related issue in an area I'm not well informed about.
Robert Hall,131,Stanford,m,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: The association between health and economic growth in poor countries primarily involves faster growth generating better health, rather than the other way around.","Thanks to products from advanced countries, poor countries have had huge improvements in longevity without much income growth."
Robert Hall,132,Stanford,m,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: The decline in the fraction of people with incomes under, say, $1 per day is a good measure of whether well-being is improving among low-income populations.","There's more to the issue, but under the Inada condition, we care desperately about people whose log consumption is close to minus infinity."
Robert Hall,133,Stanford,m,3,6,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: Expanding health insurance to more people through the ACA’s public subsidies and Medicaid expansion will reduce total healthcare spending in the economy.,The ACA caved to demands for excessively broad coverage.
Robert Hall,134,Stanford,m,3,6,Disagree,Agree,Question B: Expanding health insurance to more people through the ACA’s public subsidies and Medicaid expansion will generate gains in the health and well-being of the newly insured that exceed the costs.,The expansion of coverage was mainly intended to bring in healthy people whose payments would exceed their medical costs.
Robert Hall,135,Stanford,m,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: If the federal minimum wage is raised gradually to $15-per-hour by 2020, the employment rate for low-wage US workers will be substantially lower than it would be under the status quo.","Depends on how many exceptions are allowed. Most $15 city min wages exempt union members, for example."
Robert Hall,136,Stanford,m,8,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Increasing the federal minimum wage gradually to $15-per-hour by 2020 would substantially increase aggregate output in the US economy.,Does anybody have a mechanism in mind that would raise output? Stigler's argument that a min wage might not harm employment does not support
Robert Hall,137,Stanford,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,The median Greek citizen will be better off if there is a “yes” vote in the July 5 referendum on whether to accept the terms of the bailout package offered by Greece's creditors.,Even better would be an immediate debt writeoff coupled with a new relation to the eurosystem that blocked further access to credit.
Robert Hall,138,Stanford,m,2,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: Economic analysis can identify whether countries are using their exchange rates to benefit their own people at the expense of their trading partners’ welfare.,Optimal tariff theory says that countries should raise their prices. So policies to lower prices by devaluing must be harmful.
Robert Hall,139,Stanford,m,3,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Bank of Japan monetary policies that result in a weaker yen make Americans generally worse off.,Most Americans benefit because of lower prices of imports. Some lose because they are employed in industries competing with the devaluer.
Robert Hall,140,Stanford,m,5,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Behavior in many complex and seemingly intractable strategic settings can be understood more clearly by working out what each party in the game will choose to do if they realize that the other parties will be solving the same problem. This insight has helped us understand behavior as diverse as military conflicts, price setting by competing firms and penalty kicking in soccer.",Just being aware that others are solving similar problems doesn't lead to the successes economists have had. Rather it is Nash equilibrium.
Robert Hall,141,Stanford,m,3,7,Disagree,Agree,"The 9% cumulative increase in real US median household income since 1980 substantially understates how much better off people in the median American household are now economically, compared with 35 years ago.",Lots of real growth in the top deciles and the bottom deciles. Not so clear at the median.

A better policy would engineer a roughly Pareto improving change. Bu probably better than nothing.
Robert Hall,143,Stanford,m,9,5,Disagree,Uncertain,The Fed should wait until its preferred measure of inflation (Core PCE) is clearly rising — and not just forecast to rise — before it begins hiking interest rates.,"Confusion here between rates of change and levels. The Fed should tighten when expected inflation is above target, not just when rising."
Robert Hall,144,Stanford,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a city or state typically generates local benefits that outweigh the costs to the city and/or state providing the incentives.,

Robert Hall,148,Stanford,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,"In 10 years, per capita purchasing power in Greece will be higher if — rather than continuing to service its debts over the next decade and complying with the budget rules currently in place — it refuses to accept a continuation of its current troika program and explicitly defaults on its debt held by the official sector.","Greece seems incapable of running a big enough primary surplus to satisfy Germany, and it is probably harmful to try. Autarky is better."
Robert Hall,149,Stanford,m,9,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Changing federal income tax rates, or the income bases to which those rates apply, can affect federal tax revenues partly by altering people’s behavior, and thus their actual or reported incomes.",The only possible question is the magnitude.
Robert Hall,150,Stanford,m,4,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: To the extent that a given tax change might affect revenues partly by affecting national-income growth, existing research provides enough guidance to generate informative bounds on the size of any growth-driven revenue effect.","A lot depends on the response of monetary policy, and there is no agreement on how much policy should or does respond to output changes."
Robert Hall,151,Stanford,m,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question C: For large proposed changes in tax rates or the tax base, official revenue forecasts provided to Congress would probably be more accurate if the CBO and JCT tried to estimate fully how the proposed tax changes would affect growth-driven revenue.","Again, the response of other elements of policy, monetary and fiscal, needs to be factored in, and there is great uncertainty."
Robert Hall,152,Stanford,m,1,5,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Most college professors who assign textbooks would not be able to guess, within 10% of the actual figure, the retail price that their students pay for new copies of those books.",I'd run a survey if I wanted to know
Robert Hall,153,Stanford,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Since students can resell college textbooks or rent electronic versions, the net burden on students is substantially lower than retail prices for new textbook purchases would suggest.",...to a person who was unaware of the resale market (not me!)
Robert Hall,154,Stanford,m,5,5,Agree,Disagree,"Question C:
Even though the professors who select textbooks are different form the people who pay for them, the price of new edition college textbooks reflect classic forces of supply and demand.","Provided one takes a broad view of supply and demand--printed books are a sunset product, and thus pricey."
Robert Hall,155,Stanford,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,The recent decline in oil prices will promote higher real GDP in the US over the next couple of years.,"The 1986 decline had little effect on real GDP. Oil prices don't shift production functions. Real income rises, but not real output."
Robert Hall,156,Stanford,m,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,A US city hosting a big convention will enjoy a higher boost to incremental spending — holding the number of visitors and their average incomes fixed — if those visitors are auto dealers rather than economists.,Those dealers know how to have fun...
Robert Hall,157,Stanford,m,6,6,Uncertain,Disagree,A typical country can increase its citizens’ welfare by enacting policies that would increase its trade surplus (or decrease its trade deficit).,"Focusing on trade is basically mercantilism.

Robert Hall,162,Stanford,m,2,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: Amazon has monopsony power in the market for books that is significantly reducing the supply of books.,Complicated issue. The main bone of contention so far has been its policy of low pricing for ebooks. Not sure of the effects on authors.

Amazon has sufficient monopsony power that regulatory intervention is likely to make consumers of books better off, taking into account implementation costs and the effect of intervention on incentives.",
Robert Hall,164,Stanford,m,7,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,The most powerful force pushing towards greater wealth inequality in the US since the 1970s is the gap between the after-tax return on capital and the economic growth rate.,A glance at the biographies of the truly rich shows most came from upper middle class families.

Robert Hall,199,Stanford,m,2,4,Uncertain,Disagree,"Experience over the past 30 years shows that for the typical emerging market nation facing rapid capital outflows, spending foreign currency reserves to defend its currency is a better policy for its citizens than not doing so.",Really tough question. Outside.my expertise.
Robert Hall,200,Stanford,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Conventional economic reasoning suggests that it would be a good policy to enact the recent Senate bill that would let undergraduate students borrow through the government Stafford program at interest rates equivalent to the primary credit rates offered to banks through the Federal Reserve's discount window.,There are so many things wrong with the student loan program that changing the interest rate is down the list.
Robert Hall,201,Stanford,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,An effective way to increase savings rates of employees whose firms have defined contribution plans is to combine automatic enrollment in those plans and periodic automatic increases in their contributions (with the ability to opt out of either).,An age-contingent default might be even better.
Robert Hall,202,Stanford,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,Sustained tax and spending policies that boost consumption in ways that reduce the saving rate are likely to lower long-run living standards.,Only an unlikely exotic economy could over come the basic principle that more now means less later.
Robert Hall,203,Stanford,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Slavery in the United States was eradicated because of social and political events, not because it was an unprofitable institution for slaveholders.","I would have said ""Slavery was abolished because it was morally deeply wrong, not because it was in the owners' interest to free slaves"""
Robert Hall,204,Stanford,m,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Restricting US exports of liquefied natural gas would have adverse effects on the US economy.,Totally basic economics--gains from trade
Robert Hall,205,Stanford,m,8,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Because the US has underspent on new projects, maintenance, or both, the federal government has an opportunity to increase average incomes by spending more on roads, railways, bridges and airports.",Serious overspending currently on rail. Roads and bridges need user charges. Not many true public goods that call for higher spending.
Robert Hall,206,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Past experience of public spending and political economy suggests that if the government spent more on roads, railways, bridges and airports, many of the projects would have low or negative returns.","True for rail. For other infrastructure, the main problem is not the spending, but rather the failure to impose appropriate user charges."
Robert Hall,207,Stanford,m,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,Reducing the income-tax deductibility of charitable gifts is a less distortionary way to raise new revenue than raising the same amount of revenue through a proportional increase in all marginal tax rates.,Some but hardly all charitable giving generates public goods and thus relieves distortions. We should keep the good deductions only.
Robert Hall,208,Stanford,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"A bitcoin's value derives solely from the belief that others will want to use it for trade, which implies that its purchasing power is likely to fluctuate over time to a degree that will limit its usefulness.","In principle, production cost puts a ceiling on its value, but there is no floor. No protection from competition, unlike the dollar."
Robert Hall,209,Stanford,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Countries that let their debt loads get high risk losing control of their own fiscal sustainability, through an adverse feedback loop in which doubts by lenders lead to higher government bond rates, which in turn make debt problems more severe.","Simple math...interesting that it has not happened to Japan, however."
Robert Hall,210,Stanford,m,7,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Refusing to liberalize trade unless partner countries adopt new labor or environmental rules is a bad policy, because even if the new standards would reduce distortions on some dimensions, such a policy involves threatening to maintain large distortions in the form of restricted trade.",Policymakers seem to think that granting the right to export to the US is a valuable privilege that comes at some cost to the US.
Robert Hall,211,Stanford,m,1,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,Using government funds to guarantee preschool education for four-year olds would yield a much lower social return than the ones achieved by the most highly touted targeted preschool initiatives.,"If we used the gov funds to propagate the most highly touted programs, wouldn't we get a good result? But I don't have any expertise here."
Robert Hall,212,Stanford,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment.,I'm aware that some fairly clean natural experiments have not found effects.
Robert Hall,213,Stanford,m,4,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: The distortionary costs of raising the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour and indexing it to inflation are sufficiently small compared with the benefits to low-skilled workers who can find employment that this would be a desirable policy.,"The benefits go to the somewhat more skilled at the expense of the lowest, which does not seem to be desirable policy."
Robert Hall,214,Stanford,m,3,7,Uncertain,Agree,The average US citizen would be better off if a larger number of highly educated foreign workers were legally allowed to immigrate to the US each year.,"The big issue in immigration is the families of the workers. Almost any worker is a benefit, but the other family members may be costly."
Robert Hall,215,Stanford,m,7,6,Disagree,Agree,The persistent deflation in Japan since 1997 could have been avoided had the Bank of Japan followed different monetary policies.,"Central banks lose control of the price level at the zero lower bound, when their reserves become close substitutes for government debt."
Robert Hall,216,Stanford,m,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,"Because all federal spending and taxes must be approved by both houses of Congress and the executive branch, a separate debt ceiling that has to be increased periodically creates unneeded uncertainty and can potentially lead to worse fiscal outcomes.",This is a question about the behavior of members of Congress. I don't see how an economist could have any expertise on this.
Robert Hall,217,Stanford,m,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,The federal government would make the average U.S. citizen better off by using policies that directly focus more on increasing small business growth than growth of economic output overall.,"Small business is held back by the burden of its undiversified idiosyncratic risk. But I don't think the gov can do much about it.

Robert Hall,218,Stanford,m,4,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,The annual indexing of Social Security benefits to increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (the CPI-W) leads to higher benefits than would be required to compensate recipients for genuine cost-of-living increases.,"The NIPA PCE index, taken by many to be more accurate, turns out to underweight housing, so it's hard to tell."
Robert Hall,219,Stanford,m,4,7,Uncertain,Agree,"The Brookings Institution recently described a US carbon tax of $20 per ton, increasing at 4% per year, which would raise an estimated $150 billion per year in federal revenues over the next decade. Given the negative externalities created by carbon dioxide emissions, a federal carbon tax at this rate would involve fewer harmful net distortions to the US economy than a tax increase that generated the same revenue by raising marginal tax rates on labor income across the board.","There's reasonable evidence that carbon emissions raise the temp, but it is less clear that the net effects of warming are negative."
Robert Hall,220,Stanford,m,6,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: Because federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will continue to grow under current policy beyond the 10-year window of most political budget debates, it is easy for a politician to devise a budget plan that would reduce federal deficits over the next decade without really making the U.S. fiscally sustainable.","Health spending spending will rise a lot in 10 years, so a plan that limited the deficit for that period of time would be a good step"
Robert Hall,221,Stanford,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Comparing two plans that would reduce federal budget deficits by identical amounts in each of the next 10 years, one that did so partly by reducing significantly the long-term growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid spending would do more to make the U.S. budget fiscally sustainable than one that did not lower the growth of these spending programs.",Rationalizing Medicare and bringing contributions for higher-income families into line with benefits would be a good idea on its own.
Robert Hall,222,Stanford,m,5,6,Disagree,Agree,Question A: Taking into account all of the economic consequences — including the incentives of banks to ensure their own liquidity and solvency in the future — the benefits of bailing out U.S. banks in 2008 will end up exceeding the costs.,Not compared to an ideal policy of an orderly reorganization imposing losses on creditors according to seniority. But better than chaotic.
Robert Hall,223,Stanford,m,6,6,Disagree,Agree,"Question B: Because GM and Chrysler were bailed out in 2008-09, the U.S. unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would it have been if Congress and the executive branch had not intervened.","Again, it would have been better to reorganize with suitable losses on the junior creditors. This would not have resulted in higher unemp."
Robert Hall,224,Stanford,m,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,Question C: Taking into account all of the economic consequences — including effects on corporate managers' incentives and on creditors' expectations of how their claims will be treated in future bankruptcies — the benefits of bailing out GM and Chrysler will end up exceeding the costs.,See previous answer
Robert Hall,225,Stanford,m,8,6,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: The U.S government should make further efforts to shrink the size of the country's largest banks — such as by capping the size of their liabilities or penalizing large banks more heavily through taxes or other means — because the existing regulations do not require the biggest banks to internalize enough of the ""too-big-to-fail"" risks that they pose.",Limiting assets is largely ineffective because banks can take similar risks and earn similar returns using swaps rather than holding assets.
Robert Hall,226,Stanford,m,7,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: The economic benefits to the U.S. of having a handful of banks with balance sheets greater than $1 trillion are small.,"Any returns to scale are likely exhausted at smaller scale. But we should not measure size by assets, but by exposure."
Robert Hall,227,Stanford,m,4,6,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: The federal government would make the average U.S. citizen better off by using policies that directly focus more on increasing manufacturing employment than employment in other sectors.,"Tremendously complicated. Many US manufactured goods have high profit margins, so correcting the distortion would help us and others"
Robert Hall,228,Stanford,m,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Because firms and inventors do not capture the full returns from research and development, the government would increase the average well-being of Americans (and potentially of others too) by favoring R&D using the tax code.","Nordhaus has shown how much leakage of ideas occurs into the worldwide public domain. Of course, the US would capture only a quarter of gain"
Robert Hall,229,Stanford,m,4,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Consider one of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that President Obama enacted in the Affordable Care Act — reducing Medicare-related payments to private insurers and altering the payment system for doctors and hospitals — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because over time the supply of doctors, hospitals and insurers willing to offer them health services may decline in response to restrained payments.","It seems unlikely that such serious cutbacks would ever occur. The risk is to the government's fiscal position, not to US health."
Robert Hall,230,Stanford,m,4,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: Consider the other of two proposals for restraining future Medicare spending, each by the same amount: The method that Governor Romney advocates — giving future seniors a fixed payment for premiums and letting private insurers compete with Medicare — imposes risks on future Medicare patients because competition may not be powerful to enough to offer future seniors the same quality of care that is currently promised without supplementing their premium support.","So, of course, premium support in lieu of Medicare would be raised. Again the risk is to fiscal, not medical, health."
Robert Hall,231,Stanford,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Claims by incumbent presidents and challengers about how many private-sector jobs can be created in a four-year period by sector-level or other targeted policies should be viewed as rough guesses, because overall macroeconomic conditions drive aggregate employment in ways that dominate any net effects of polices that focus on specific industries or households.",No doubt about this whatsoever!
Robert Hall,232,Stanford,m,6,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: One drawback of taxing capital income at a lower rate than labor income is that it gives people incentives to relabel income that policymakers find hard to categorize as ""capital"" rather than labor"".","Apart from the issue of carried interest, this is not a big issue in taxation."
Robert Hall,233,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Despite relabeling concerns, taxing capital income at a permanently lower rate than labor income would result in higher average long-term prosperity, relative to an alternative that generated the same amount of tax revenue by permanently taxing capital and labor income at equal rates instead.",Mirrlees-type arguments for taxation of the return to capital involve a sacrifice of the total size of the pot to bring about redistribution
Robert Hall,234,Stanford,m,9,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Although they do not always agree about the precise likely effects of different tax policies, another reason why economists often give disparate advice on tax policy is because they hold differing views about choices between raising average prosperity and redistributing income.",The key parameter is the elasticity of substitution in the social welfare function across people. We don't agree on that.
Robert Hall,235,Stanford,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: By discounting pension liabilities at high interest rates under government accounting standards, many U.S. state and local governments understate their pension liabilities and the costs of providing pensions to public-sector workers.",This is a big problem with corporate pensions too.
Robert Hall,236,Stanford,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: During the next two decades some U.S. states, unless they substantially increase taxes, cut spending, and/or change public-sector pensions, will require a combination of severe austerity budgets, a federal bailout, and/or default.",They can forget federal bailouts!
Robert Hall,237,Stanford,m,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Even if the third round of quantitative easing that the Fed recently announced increases real GDP growth over the next two years, the increase will be inconsequential.","Current activity depends mainly on shorter rates, so lowering long rates has little effect.

Robert Hall,239,Stanford,m,9,5,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question C: Even if inflationary pressures rise substantially as a result of quantitative easing and low interest rates, the Federal Reserve has ample tools to rein inflation back in if it chooses to do so.","There's no upper bound on the Fed's contractionary power--it can sell bonds and raise the interest rate on reserves, the latter sans limit."
Robert Hall,240,Stanford,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: Ethanol content requirements and protectionism against imported ethanol (which includes fuel from sugarcane) raise food prices without significantly reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.,

Robert Hall,245,Stanford,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,The current trade barriers in the U.S. sugar industry raise the profits of sugar producers and make the typical U.S. consumer pay more for sugar and goods that use sugar as an input.,
Robert Hall,246,Stanford,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,Question A: Loans to students attending for-profit colleges are especially risky because students attending them have had default rates that greatly exceed those for comparable students attending public and non-profit private institutions.,

Robert Hall,251,Stanford,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,Taxes or bans on large bottles of soft drinks containing sugar are not likely to have a significant effect on obesity rates because people will substitute towards consuming excessive calories in other ways.,
Robert Hall,252,Stanford,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,Subjecting online sales from out-of-state vendors to the same retail sales taxes imposed on in-state sales would raise more tax revenue in the states making this change while reducing the pro-online bias of current policy.,
Robert Hall,253,Stanford,m,7,5,Agree,Agree,"Consumers would not necessarily be better off if cable and satellite TV firms were required to offer a la carte pricing for individual channels, because the networks' programming charges and the satellite-and-cable fees could adjust in response to this rule.",Bundling is the natural pricing model with fairly homogeneous preferences. Consumers with low values would gain from unbundling.
Robert Hall,254,Stanford,m,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Long run fiscal sustainability in the U.S. will require cuts in currently promised Medicare and Medicaid benefits and/or tax increases that include higher taxes on households with incomes below $250,000.",Rationalization is a better term than cuts. Equal health outcomes are possible with much less spending.
Robert Hall,255,Stanford,m,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: Assuming that Germany eventually agrees to backstop the debt of southern European countries, the eurozone as a whole will be better off if that bailout is unconditional, rather than accompanied by the labor market reforms and future budget controls that Germany is demanding of countries in return.","Although the ideal regime to bring discipline to economic policies of the southern Euro countries would be self-reliance, conditions are 2nd"

There's no way Germany could bail out everything.
Robert Hall,257,Stanford,m,7,6,Disagree,Agree,Question C: The main reason other eurozone countries need to worry about Greek banks losing access to ECB support is because the ensuing chaos in Greece could trigger bank runs in peripheral countries.,"We should care about Greece and apply tough love for its own sake, not just the stability of other countries."
Robert Hall,258,Stanford,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: A cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would lead to higher GDP within five years than without the tax cut.,"The government has to satisfy its budget constraint, so one can't say anything about a tax cut without knowing what else happens."
Robert Hall,259,Stanford,m,5,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Question B: A cut in federal income tax rates in the US right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut.,"See previous question.

Robert Hall,262,Stanford,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,An important reason why private college and university tuition has risen faster than the CPI during the past few decades is because competition for faculty members — whose potential earnings in other sectors have steadily improved — has driven up their pay faster than their productivity.,"Higher ed is like other human-service-intensive activities, bound to become more expensive relative to goods production.No special force."
Robert Hall,263,Stanford,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"If the fiscal changes that are planned under current US law take place next year — including Bush era tax cuts expiring, Medicare payment rates to doctors being cut, the AMT applying to many more taxpayers, and automatic cuts in defense and non-defense discretionary spending kicking in — then US real GDP growth in 2013 will be lower than it would be under the CBO's alternative fiscal scenario, in which the above changes do not occur.",All macro models agree that lower product demand and higher taxes reduce current output and employment.
Robert Hall,264,Stanford,m,7,5,Agree,Disagree,"New technology for fracking natural gas, by lowering energy costs in the United States, will make US industrial firms more cost competitive and thus significantly stimulate the growth of US merchandise exports.","More important, it raises real income and thus consumption.

Robert Hall,265,Stanford,m,4,6,Agree,Agree,Cuba’s low per-capita income growth — 1.2 percent per year since 1960 —has more to do with Cuba’s own economic policies than with the U.S. embargo on trade and tourism.,"That is, with free-market policies and honest competent government, a Caribbean country could prosper without US trade or tourists."

Robert Hall,293,Stanford,m,3,5,Disagree,Agree,Question B: The Netherlands restrictions on “soft drugs” combined with a moderate tax aimed at deterring their consumption would have lower social costs than continuing to prohibit use of those drugs as in the US.

Robert Hall,294,Stanford,m,7,6,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Credible assumptions for inflation, GDP growth and primary budget deficits in Italy imply that either the Debt-to-GDP ratio in Italy would increase sharply if Italian interest rates on 10-year government debt remained at the November 30 level of around 7 percent or Italy would lose access to the bond market.",Zero real GDP growth and huge outstanding debt make the deficit growth high even though Italy has a small primary surplus.
Robert Hall,295,Stanford,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Absent outside help to deal with runs, such as a pledge of fiscal support from Germany or an unlimited commitment by the ECB to buy bonds, there is no spending-and-tax plan Italy can announce that would be credible enough to hold its interest rates low enough to stabilize its Debt-to-GDP ratio.","This is a question about Italian politics where I'm no expert, but progress so far in lowering real wages and improving TFP has been small."

We really need a comprehensive consumption tax, not little changes."
Robert Hall,299,Stanford,m,8,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: Reducing the deductibility of interest expenses for non-financial businesses to equalize the overall tax cost of debt and equity financing, while using the extra revenue to reduce personal and corporate tax rates in a budget neutral fashion that also keeps the burden of taxes the same, would lead to more efficient financing decisions by firms.","Can't even think about removing interest deduction while retaining taxation of interest receipts.

Robert Shimer,50,Chicago,m,1,6,Uncertain,Agree,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Robert Shimer,107,Chicago,m,1,6,Uncertain,Agree,Question A: Allowing US-based employers to hire many more immigrants with advanced degrees in science or engineering would lower (at least temporarily) the premium earned by current American workers with similar degrees.,"Obvious effects by shifting supply; however, this will also affect where production takes place, so demand shifts as well"
Robert Shimer,108,Chicago,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Allowing US-based employers to hire many more immigrants with advanced degrees in science or engineering would raise per capita income in the US over time.,"Most other workers are complements to those with advanced degrees, hence this will raise the demand for their skills"

Robert Shimer,111,Chicago,m,8,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Granting every American citizen over 21-years old a universal basic income of $13,000 a year — financed by eliminating all transfer programs (including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, housing subsidies, household welfare payments, and farm and corporate subsidies) — would be a better policy than the status quo.",Simplicity and improvement in some incentives are good. But largely this policy would be redistributive.

Robert Shimer,114,Chicago,m,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: The four largest domestic US banks currently have around 40% of the industry’s domestic assets (an average of 10% each). In early 1998, before Glass-Steagall ended and before Citicorp merged with Travelers, they held 13.2% (an average of 3.3% each). Thirty years ago, before interstate branching was fully permitted, that combined share was around 8% (an average of 2% each).
Capping US banks’ size so that no single bank could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets would lower systemic risk in the US.",
Robert Shimer,115,Chicago,m,1,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: The US financial system would contribute more to the average American's welfare if the size of US banks were capped so that none could be larger than 4% of the sector's domestic assets.,
Robert Shimer,116,Chicago,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: By providing important measures of US economic performance — including employment, consumer prices, wages, job openings, time allocation in households, and productivity — the Bureau of Labor Statistics creates social benefits that exceed its annual cost of roughly $610 million.",BLS data is essential for the Fed at a minimum. $610 million is 0.003% of US GDP.
Robert Shimer,117,Chicago,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question B: Cuts in BLS spending would likely involve net social costs because potential declines in the quality of data, and thus their usefulness to researchers and decision makers, would exceed any budget savings.",Full disclosure: much of my research uses publicly available BLS data.
Robert Shimer,118,Chicago,m,8,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,An important reason why many workers in Michigan and Ohio have lost jobs in recent years is because US presidential administrations over the past 30 years have not been tough enough in trade negotiations.,"Trade matters for job loss, but toughness in trade negotiations has a small effect on trade."
Robert Shimer,119,Chicago,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: There is no perfect voting system. That is, no voting system can ensure that the winner will be the person who best represents voters’ wishes, including how intensely they favor or disfavor each candidate.","The one exception is dictatorship, so there is only one voter.

Robert Shimer,120,Chicago,m,5,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: One clear defect of a winner-take-all election with 3 or more candidates, and with each voter choosing only one candidate, is that a candidate who is strongly disliked by a majority, but strongly liked by a minority, can beat a candidate who is liked by a majority and disliked by relatively few.",I hesitate only because I'm not sure whether this is necessarily a defect. The rest of the claim is true.

Robert Shimer,127,Chicago,m,5,6,Agree,Disagree,"Question B: The Fed should have raised interest rates sooner, rather than leaving them near zero for this long.","But only two meetings ago, in October"
Robert Shimer,128,Chicago,m,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded US firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,

Robert Shimer,131,Chicago,m,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: The association between health and economic growth in poor countries primarily involves faster growth generating better health, rather than the other way around.",There is some evidence that the relationship goes in both directions. Unclear which effect is stronger.

Robert Shimer,135,Chicago,m,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: If the federal minimum wage is raised gradually to $15-per-hour by 2020, the employment rate for low-wage US workers will be substantially lower than it would be under the status quo.","Assuming inflation stays low. There is substantial evidence that labor demand slopes down, at least in the long run"
Robert Shimer,136,Chicago,m,7,5,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Increasing the federal minimum wage gradually to $15-per-hour by 2020 would substantially increase aggregate output in the US economy.,

A no vote will lead down a much worse one, likely Grexit, legal battles, isolation, etc."
Robert Shimer,138,Chicago,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Economic analysis can identify whether countries are using their exchange rates to benefit their own people at the expense of their trading partners’ welfare.,Exchange rate policy matters because of nominal rigidities and affects on global supply and demand. Identifying these situations is tricky.

Robert Shimer,141,Chicago,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"The 9% cumulative increase in real US median household income since 1980 substantially understates how much better off people in the median American household are now economically, compared with 35 years ago.","CPI has improved but is imperfect. Capital income matters, especially for retirees. Mean household size has shrunk from around 3.3 to 2.6."
Robert Shimer,142,Chicago,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Californians would be better off on average if all final users in the state paid the same price for water — adjusted for quality, place and time — even if, as a result, some food prices rose sharply and some farms failed.","The only question is what ""on average"" means. One water price would make most Californians better off."
Robert Shimer,143,Chicago,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,The Fed should wait until its preferred measure of inflation (Core PCE) is clearly rising — and not just forecast to rise — before it begins hiking interest rates.,The Fed should raise rates when forecast inflation is above target. Now the hard question: what forecast is better than current inflation?
Robert Shimer,144,Chicago,m,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a city or state typically generates local benefits that outweigh the costs to the city and/or state providing the incentives.,"See Greenstone, Hornbeck, and Moretti (JPE 2010) for some evidence of large positive spillovers"
Robert Shimer,145,Chicago,m,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question B: The US as a whole benefits when cities or states compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,There is a clear zero-sum aspect to tax competition. But nothing else can restrain the leviathan. The balance is unclear.
Robert Shimer,146,Chicago,m,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Declining to be vaccinated against contagious diseases such as measles imposes costs on other people, which is a negative externality.",
Robert Shimer,147,Chicago,m,1,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: Considering the costs of restricting free choice, and the share of people in the US who choose not to vaccinate their children for measles, the social benefit of mandating measles vaccines for all Americans (except those with compelling medical reasons) would exceed the social cost.",
Robert Shimer,148,Chicago,m,10,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"In 10 years, per capita purchasing power in Greece will be higher if — rather than continuing to service its debts over the next decade and complying with the budget rules currently in place — it refuses to accept a continuation of its current troika program and explicitly defaults on its debt held by the official sector.","If Greece continues to service its debt, outcomes are reasonably forecastable. If it defaults, many different outcomes can happen."

Robert Shimer,150,Chicago,m,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: To the extent that a given tax change might affect revenues partly by affecting national-income growth, existing research provides enough guidance to generate informative bounds on the size of any growth-driven revenue effect.",The bounds likely rule out some outcomes but may be very wide
Robert Shimer,151,Chicago,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question C: For large proposed changes in tax rates or the tax base, official revenue forecasts provided to Congress would probably be more accurate if the CBO and JCT tried to estimate fully how the proposed tax changes would affect growth-driven revenue.",It depends on which estimates they used.
Robert Shimer,152,Chicago,m,4,5,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Most college professors who assign textbooks would not be able to guess, within 10% of the actual figure, the retail price that their students pay for new copies of those books.",
Robert Shimer,153,Chicago,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Since students can resell college textbooks or rent electronic versions, the net burden on students is substantially lower than retail prices for new textbook purchases would suggest.",It would be useful to know what fraction of books are rented or resold.
Robert Shimer,154,Chicago,m,7,5,Agree,Disagree,"Question C:
Even though the professors who select textbooks are different form the people who pay for them, the price of new edition college textbooks reflect classic forces of supply and demand.","But demand may be quite inelastic, since once a book is selected for a course, there are no substitutes."
Robert Shimer,155,Chicago,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,The recent decline in oil prices will promote higher real GDP in the US over the next couple of years.,The US is still a net energy importer and the shock is largely a supply shock. But this will cause some reallocation away from shale
Robert Shimer,156,Chicago,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,A US city hosting a big convention will enjoy a higher boost to incremental spending — holding the number of visitors and their average incomes fixed — if those visitors are auto dealers rather than economists.,

Robert Shimer,165,Chicago,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Letting car services such as Uber or Lyft compete with taxi firms on equal footing regarding genuine safety and insurance requirements, but without restrictions on prices or routes, raises consumer welfare.",This is in comparison to banning these services or regulating their price to equal the price of taxis.
Robert Shimer,166,Chicago,m,3,5,Agree,Agree,"Although there are many issues for Scotland’s voters to consider, one consequence of separating from the rest of the UK would be greater macroeconomic instability for Scotland for many years.","Change creates the potential for instability, but a floating currency with good governance could be stabilizing"

William Nordhaus,290,Yale,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,A tax on the carbon content of fuels would be a less expensive way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions than would a collection of policies such as “corporate average fuel economy” requirements for automobiles.,"Many studies on this, see RfF on national energy policies, Dec 2010 as example."
William Nordhaus,291,Yale,m,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, making drugs illegal raises street prices for those drugs because suppliers require extra compensation for the risk of incarceration and other punishments.",
William Nordhaus,292,Yale,m,9,5,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: The Netherlands restrictions on “soft drugs” combined with a moderate tax aimed at deterring their consumption would have lower social costs than continuing to prohibit use of those drugs as in the US. (Click here for a summary of the Netherlands restrictions.),
William Nordhaus,293,Yale,m,NA,6,No Opinion,Agree,"Question A: Credible assumptions for inflation, GDP growth and primary budget deficits in Italy imply that either the Debt-to-GDP ratio in Italy would increase sharply if Italian interest rates on 10-year government debt remained at the November 30 level of around 7 percent or Italy would lose access to the bond market.",
William Nordhaus,294,Yale,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,"Question B: Absent outside help to deal with runs, such as a pledge of fiscal support from Germany or an unlimited commitment by the ECB to buy bonds, there is no spending-and-tax plan Italy can announce that would be credible enough to hold its interest rates low enough to stabilize its Debt-to-GDP ratio.",
William Nordhaus,295,Yale,m,8,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,There are no consequential distortions created by the tax preference that favors obtaining health insurance through employers.,"Many well documented distortions, including differential treatment of people, and not available when people most need it."
William Nordhaus,296,Yale,m,1,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Federal mandates that government purchases should be “buy American” unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, have a significant positive impact on U.S. manufacturing employment.",Too confusing.
William Nordhaus,297,Yale,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Eliminating tax deductions for non-investment personal interest expenses (e.g., on mortgages), with reductions in personal tax rates that are both budget neutral and keep the burden of taxes by income group the same, would lead to more efficient financing decisions by individuals.","This is well studied. Perhaps some reservations for externalities of home ownership, but that has proven elusive."
William Nordhaus,298,Yale,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Reducing the deductibility of interest expenses for non-financial businesses to equalize the overall tax cost of debt and equity financing, while using the extra revenue to reduce personal and corporate tax rates in a budget neutral fashion that also keeps the burden of taxes the same, would lead to more efficient financing decisions by firms.","Complicated b/c financing structures are currently tangled, so it will be impossible to achieve assumptions. Unclear about financial firms."
William Nordhaus,299,Yale,m,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Question A: Unless they have inside information, very few investors, if any, can consistently make accurate predictions about whether the price of an individual stock will rise or fall on a given day.","Tough question because of details.

William Nordhaus,303,Yale,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, permanently raising the federal marginal tax rate on ordinary income by 1 percentage point for those in the top (i.e., currently 35%) tax bracket would increase federal tax revenue over the next 10 years.",Weight of evidence on personal tax rate with some reservations about other (state and local) taxes and other interactions.
William Nordhaus,304,Yale,m,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: The cumulative budget shortfalls in the US over the next 10 years can be reduced by half (or more) purely by increasing the federal marginal tax rate on ordinary income for those in the top tax bracket.,"Close call. With 10 yr CBO baseline def of $6 tr, indiv inc taxes of $19 tr, top 1% pays 40% of that, 50% rate. If really ""purely,"" then no.

William Nordhaus,305,Yale,m,8,4,Disagree,Disagree,"All else equal, the Fed's new plan to increase the maturity of its Treasury holdings will boost expected real GDP growth for calendar year 2012 by at least one percentage point.","Very likely to increase real output, but the effect is probably in the 0 - 1/2 percent range."
