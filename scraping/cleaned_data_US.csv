Darrell Duffie,191,Stanford,4,5,Agree,Agree,A large benefit is the pleasure of choosing something special for the receiver. Maybe one's hand-knit socks are more fun to give than cash!
Darrell Duffie,192,Stanford,1,6,Agree,Agree,Labor is a valuable factor input. My answer presumes that many of these new workers would be employed. But I'm not confident of that.
Darrell Duffie,193,Stanford,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"A higher number of workers of the same type seeking jobs would lower their average wages or employment rate, other things equal."

Darrell Duffie,226,Stanford,3,6,Disagree,Disagree,"The costs, such as ""too big to fail"" are clear, and changing. The benefits, including easier intermediation of large deals, are non trivial."
Darrell Duffie,227,Stanford,4,6,Agree,Agree,Its not obvious that this policy addresses an important externality and has low unintended consequences.
Darrell Duffie,228,Stanford,2,6,Agree,Agree,"If the positive R&D externality seems plausible, it makes sense to subsidize. There are some cases in which this has worked (universities)."

Darrell Duffie,234,Stanford,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,My anecdotal experience is that economists differ widely on the relative costs of income heterogeneity (equity versus efficiency).

Darrell Duffie,239,Stanford,2,7,Agree,Agree,"Yes, it clearly has the tools, but will it use them quickly and aggressively, especially given the short-run cost in jobs? We may find out."
Darrell Duffie,240,Stanford,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"This sounds right, although it relies a bit on some knowledge of the chemistry involved, so I am not completely confident."
Darrell Duffie,241,Stanford,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,It would be pure coincidence if forced substitution of one input for another is efficient. A permit market can give the correct tradeoff.

Kenneth Judd,9,Stanford,8,5,Agree,Agree,Some forms of rationing would have to be used and queuing times is one likely result.

Kenneth Judd,11,Stanford,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,The UK is not large enough for there to be a sizable effect.
Kenneth Judd,12,Stanford,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"I generally favor allowing voluntary transactions, but I suspect that demand is usually driven by behavior inconsistent with rationality."
Kenneth Judd,13,Stanford,10,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,Monetary policy is based on data that is aggregated over space and time. Weather events will have very small impact on that data.
Kenneth Judd,14,Stanford,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"If financial stability is threatened by more bad weather, then we are in deep trouble when it comes to handling the explosion in debt."
Kenneth Judd,15,Stanford,3,4,Agree,Uncertain,Lotteries were oversold when introduced but there is a demand for this product and little evidence that consumers are involuntarily harmed.
Kenneth Judd,16,Stanford,7,7,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Well-constructed experiments are informative. However, one must avoid excessive generalization and extrapolation."
Kenneth Judd,17,Stanford,7,7,Agree,Agree,Policies for reducing poverty must be based on a long-run perspective. Experiments that also have a long-run focus can be valuable.
Kenneth Judd,18,Stanford,9,6,Agree,Agree,"Political power often comes with wealth. The ideal is ""one person, one vote"". ""One dollar, one vote"" is not democracy."
Kenneth Judd,19,Stanford,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Trump's ""populist"" policy included a reduction in corporate taxation, which will increase inequality. Populists don't seem to care."
Kenneth Judd,20,Stanford,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Government should focus on doing its job in providing education and safety. Populism is partly based on a view that government is not.
Kenneth Judd,21,Stanford,6,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,This depends on the regulatory environment. IF laws impose the proper constraints THEN maximizing value will not create externalities.
Kenneth Judd,22,Stanford,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"In light of the current litigation regarding opioids, it is clear that things could be improved."

Kenneth Judd,48,Stanford,8,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Revenue may be higher, but the impact on output would be substantial. E.g., many will convert earned income to perks or capital gains."

Kenneth Judd,55,Stanford,7,6,Disagree,Agree,Congestion is a serious problem in the center of these cities. Caps would help alleviate congestion.
Kenneth Judd,56,Stanford,8,7,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Pricing based on congestion is far better than a cap which reduces cars at all times, even when congestion is low."
Kenneth Judd,57,Stanford,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Diamond-Mirrlees result: thou shalt not tax intermediate goods. Concept of effective protection pointed to this 40+years ago.
Kenneth Judd,58,Stanford,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Productivity depends on human, physical, and intellectual capital accumulation. Central banks do not have tools to affect such investments."
Kenneth Judd,59,Stanford,6,4,Uncertain,Disagree,
Kenneth Judd,60,Stanford,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,Demand for this is high. Should reduce $ going to organized crime. We need regulation & taxes to deal with gambling addiction problems.

Kenneth Judd,69,Stanford,8,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,
Kenneth Judd,70,Stanford,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,"I don't see any ""fundamental"" value. It is like paper money where the value is determined by some social consensus."
Kenneth Judd,71,Stanford,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,Significant deviations from that prediction would imply that current holders are ignoring arbitrage opportunities.
Kenneth Judd,72,Stanford,10,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Productivity declines with age. Current policy discourages work by older people. Simple arithmetic tells you what will happen.
Kenneth Judd,73,Stanford,8,7,Agree,Agree,Output and tax revenue rise. Young could lose if labor market frictions are not fixed.
Kenneth Judd,74,Stanford,7,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,The traditional measurement is unemployment rate. The ratio of employment to population depends on demographics as much as economic health.
Kenneth Judd,75,Stanford,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"The last time we had sustained unemployment rate below 4% was 66-69, the peak of the Viet Nam war."

Kenneth Judd,82,Stanford,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,Unemployment insurance benefits will be used to facilitate longer job search spells in the job market with fewer opportunities.
Kenneth Judd,83,Stanford,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"The key word is ""could"". It is unclear how effective the political institutions will be in making this happen. I am pessimistic."
Kenneth Judd,84,Stanford,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,Nominal features of the tax code will drag down growth. Higher inflation may have higher uncertainty.
Kenneth Judd,85,Stanford,5,5,Agree,Agree,"That is technically true, but I doubt that it would justify a higher interest rate target."
Kenneth Judd,86,Stanford,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"If a dynamically balanced budget is expected, then timing of fiscal deficits will not affect anything."
Kenneth Judd,87,Stanford,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"The need is there, and interest rates are low."
Kenneth Judd,88,Stanford,7,6,Uncertain,Disagree,Substantial loss of revenues will require cuts in spending. Where? Defense? Medical research? Infrastructure? All will be at risk.
Kenneth Judd,89,Stanford,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"This is a serious problem in education. If you are good at math, why would you want to be a high school teacher?"
Kenneth Judd,90,Stanford,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,The purpose of the Reagan tax cut was to reduce taxes relative to what they would have been. He succeeded.
Kenneth Judd,91,Stanford,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Disagree,Panelist meant to Strongly Disagree (question misread). Removing state tax deduction will raise education tax burdens. That will hurt growth
Kenneth Judd,92,Stanford,7,4,Disagree,Disagree,"The impact will not be ""substantial"". Trade deficit implies capital surplus"
Kenneth Judd,93,Stanford,8,5,Agree,Disagree, what is bad about that?
Kenneth Judd,94,Stanford,8,9,Agree,Strongly Agree,Certainly in the short run.
Kenneth Judd,95,Stanford,8,7,Agree,Agree,The job is made more difficult by the unwillingness of economists to use modern tools of analysis.
Kenneth Judd,96,Stanford,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,This is my belief. Unfortunately economists do not believe in serious retrospective analysis of past forecasts.
Kenneth Judd,97,Stanford,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Even if they were replaced by residents that are currently not working, there would be no net change in tax revenues."
Kenneth Judd,98,Stanford,7,5,Agree,Agree,Many American workers are complementary to the H1-B workers. Net job impact is unclear.
Kenneth Judd,99,Stanford,6,6,Uncertain,Agree,
Kenneth Judd,100,Stanford,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"The rise in prices could be due to a reduction in uncertainty, not to a change in expectations."

Kenneth Judd,107,Stanford,8,6,Disagree,Agree,Consumers would lose. A few would gain but there are more efficient ways to transfer income to people.
Kenneth Judd,108,Stanford,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Any effect would be tiny at any politically feasible level of such immigration.
Kenneth Judd,109,Stanford,8,5,Agree,Agree,"Complementarities with other factors, including labor, imply that they would see demand increase."
Kenneth Judd,110,Stanford,6,5,Uncertain,Agree,
Kenneth Judd,111,Stanford,8,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,The economic impact rest of EU is unclear since UK is less than 20% of EU. If Brexit leads to EU collapse then impact will be bad.
Kenneth Judd,112,Stanford,8,4,Disagree,Uncertain,"13K is inadequate for anyone with no other income. Some people eligible for welfare choose to not apply, making this proposal unnecessary."
Kenneth Judd,113,Stanford,6,7,Uncertain,Agree,"""Income"" includes capital gains. The low interest rates have surely contributed to the substantial capital gains that accrued to the rich."
Kenneth Judd,114,Stanford,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,The rate is too high. Better idea is to make insurance costs equally deductible for all.
Kenneth Judd,115,Stanford,7,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,My worry is that most banks pursue similar business strategies. Many banks doing risky things is no safer than a few banks doing the same.
Kenneth Judd,116,Stanford,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"I have antitrust concerns. If a bank's 4% is concentrated in one region, then it may have excessive market power."
Kenneth Judd,117,Stanford,10,7,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Information is good.
Kenneth Judd,118,Stanford,9,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"I doubt we have too much information of excessive quality. Reallocation of resources may be desired, but not cuts."
Kenneth Judd,119,Stanford,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Many jobs went to the US South. Increases in productivity reduced jobs. New jobs were created due to access to foreign labor.

Kenneth Judd,124,Stanford,8,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Countries that had the same policy preferences as UK will have less power. UK might form an alternative free trade framework.
Kenneth Judd,125,Stanford,3,6,Agree,Agree,"Like 20th century Japan, Germany, etc., they are catching up with other economies and will slow down as they approach US/EU productivity."
Kenneth Judd,126,Stanford,8,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Signaling effects, each trying to be the best giver, create waste. Most actions are freely chosen. Net effect is likely positive."
Kenneth Judd,127,Stanford,8,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"The Fed spends many 10^7 dollars annually on econ research. In mid-2008, the Fed did not think that a crisis was at hand. With my budget..."
Kenneth Judd,128,Stanford,7,5,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,I cannot be more knowledgeable than the Fed.
Kenneth Judd,129,Stanford,7,5,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,This would increase the information difference between insiders and outsiders. Management would have more time to hide their mistakes.

Kenneth Judd,160,Stanford,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,A temporary change would produce far more investment in accounting methods for exploiting this than in real capital.

Kenneth Judd,170,Stanford,6,6,Uncertain,Agree,The same is true of many investments in the private sector. Hard to imagine the government having a better record than the private sector.

Kenneth Judd,188,Stanford,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,It may have a short-run impact but there is no reason to believe that it is permanent.
Kenneth Judd,189,Stanford,6,8,Agree,Agree,"Innovation need not slow. The vast changes in what we consume and how we work make ""income"" a poor measure of wellbeing over a century."

Oliver Hart,72,Harvard,10,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,It seems unlikely that the optimistic growth figures are correct and so the budget deficit will rise unless government cuts are made.

Oliver Hart,80,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Nominal rates would be higher and so could be reduced without hitting the zero lower bound. Also real rates would be lower.

Oliver Hart,93,Harvard,10,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,The evidence suggests that expenditure by tourists is small and that locals who spend more on this sport spend less on other activities.

Oliver Hart,97,Harvard,6,6,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Many forces are responsible for middle-class people feeling left behind. These policies may make things worse by raising prices of imports.

Oliver Hart,100,Harvard,10,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,It all depends on how much revenue can be raised by increasing taxes on those earning more than 250K. I don't know the answer to this.
Oliver Hart,101,Harvard,7,6,Agree,Agree,Duties lead to dead-weight losses and also retaliation.There can be losers from free trade but there are better ways to compensate them.
Oliver Hart,102,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,"This seems very likely. The immigrants are chiefly substitutes for the US scientists. However, some might be complements, offsetting this."
Oliver Hart,103,Harvard,8,5,Agree,Agree,A simple free trade argument suggest that the U.S. would gain overall. The problem is that there may be losers as well as winners.
Oliver Hart,104,Harvard,8,5,Agree,Agree,A post-Brexit agreement between U.K. and E.U. is likely to involve trade barriers. This will reduce gains from trade. The U.K. will suffer.
Oliver Hart,105,Harvard,10,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Both sides gain from trade and so the EU will also suffer. The per capita loss is likely to be smaller simply because the EU is bigger.
Oliver Hart,106,Harvard,5,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Bill Gates would get 13K, which is crazy. Raising taxes is costly and so redistribution should be targeted to those who need help most."
Oliver Hart,107,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Quantitative easing has boosted asset prices, reduced interest rates and lowered unemployment. The overall effect on inequality is unclear."
Oliver Hart,108,Harvard,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"I think so. It would be better to count employer-based health insurance as taxable income, but the Cadillac tax is better than nothing."
Oliver Hart,109,Harvard,5,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,With banks being smaller no single bank's failure would lead to serious contagion or undermine the confidence of investors and depositors.
Oliver Hart,110,Harvard,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,There are benefits of large banks as well as costs. Regulation should include shadow banks and be more flexible than a cap on size.
Oliver Hart,111,Harvard,8,7,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"The BLS provides data, in an objective and neutral manner, that are essential for policy. Its benefits exceed its costs."
Oliver Hart,112,Harvard,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,Same answer as before.
Oliver Hart,113,Harvard,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Job losses occur because of automation, energy prices, tastes, as well as trade. A tougher policy could have been worse not better."
Oliver Hart,114,Harvard,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,We know from Arrow's impossibility theorem that no voting system can aggregate preferences perfectly even if people vote honestly.
Oliver Hart,115,Harvard,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,"46% of people rank 3 candidates A,C,B. ( A first, B last.) 44% rank them B,C,A. 10% rank them C,B,A. Then A wins,but C may be better."

Oliver Hart,122,Harvard,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,There seems to be a social need for public celebrations and gifts. But some are forced to participate.The net benefit is unclear.
Oliver Hart,123,Harvard,10,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,I don't think so. The recovery is still weak and there are no serious signs of inflation. Also a little inflation may be good.
Oliver Hart,124,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Agree,See answer to last question.
Oliver Hart,125,Harvard,8,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,I am in favor of letting firms do this but only if it is part of their charter or approved by shareholders. It should not be a blanket rule.
Oliver Hart,126,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"For some firms it might be better, for others worse. This is not a case where one size fits all."
Oliver Hart,127,Harvard,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,Research by Chetty et al. suggests this is so and I take that seriously. But this is a complex issue and it is early to reach conclusions.
Oliver Hart,128,Harvard,10,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Better health can surely increase productivity and hence growth but it is hard to believe that the causation mainly goes this way.
Oliver Hart,129,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,It is probably not a great measure unless it incorporates the prices of local goods. Also it misses out on non-traded goods and services.
Oliver Hart,130,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,It could fall as people get more preventative care
Oliver Hart,131,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain, or rise as people use doctors more. Some evidence suggests the latter but it's early.
Oliver Hart,132,Harvard,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,ACA allows ill people to see doctors and provides peace of mind. Both would be negotiated behind the veil of ignorance. Net benefit>0.
Oliver Hart,133,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,I worry that it will be but we don't know enough. Firms may raise prices and the Fed may accommodate some inflation. But the change is large
Oliver Hart,134,Harvard,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,If employment not much affected and redistribution to workers demand could rise. But if sizable unemployment opposite could occur.
Oliver Hart,135,Harvard,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Yes means more of the same for Greece. No means a very uncertain future. But the Euro was a bad idea and should end as soon as possible.
Oliver Hart,136,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,"The answer depends on whether prices are flexible or sticky,the importance of foreign inputs in domestic goods. So hard to assess welfare."
Oliver Hart,137,Harvard,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,Again it depends on whether prices are flexible or sticky. Also Americans benefit from cheaper Japanese goods. So hard to say.
Oliver Hart,138,Harvard,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Nash equilibrium is enormously useful. But people can be less rational than the theory supposes and so the predictions may be misleading.
Oliver Hart,139,Harvard,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Iphones weren't available then suggesting understatement. But both partners often work, which is stressful. This suggests overstatement."
Oliver Hart,140,Harvard,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Equal prices imply that all final users will value the last gallon they use the same, which ensures efficiency. Consumer rationing does not."
Oliver Hart,141,Harvard,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,The recovery is anemic and I am more concerned that it will fizzle than I am worried about inflation. The Fed should not be too cautious.
Oliver Hart,142,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,If it's done carefully--the firms can't get the tax benefits and then leave--this can pay off for a city or state.
Oliver Hart,143,Harvard,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,There is no social benefit to the US as a whole unless the firms would have located abroad. There is a social loss from lower tax receipts.
Oliver Hart,144,Harvard,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,The science seems absolutely clear. If you are not vaccincated others are more likely to catch the disease ( as well as you).
Oliver Hart,145,Harvard,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,Another way to internalize the externality is to make those who don't get vaccinated pay a fine. But a mandate is adminstratively easier.
Oliver Hart,146,Harvard,7,5,Agree,Agree,"For Greece: default is a plus,exclusion from the EU banking system is a minus- it could lead to bank runs and political chaos. Net unclear."
Oliver Hart,147,Harvard,8,7,Agree,Agree,Consider an increase of income tax rates to 100%. Reported income would be close to zero after this.
Oliver Hart,148,Harvard,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,I doubt that we know enough. There are disagreements about the response of labor supply to moderate changes in income tax rates.
Oliver Hart,149,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,The estimates would not be perfect but they would be better than assuming no response.
Oliver Hart,150,Harvard,5,6,Agree,Agree,"My guess is that most pick what they think is the best book (or, of course, their own book) without regard to price."
Oliver Hart,151,Harvard,10,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"This seems rather self-evident, although perhaps not all students can do this. Some people no doubt also photo-copy parts of books."
Oliver Hart,152,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,In some fields there will be a prominent book with few competitors. The author has some monopoly power
Oliver Hart,153,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain, the equilibrium price may be high.
Oliver Hart,154,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,There are potentially confounding general equilibrium effects but the US as a net importer of oil should benefit from increased fracking.
Oliver Hart,155,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,Dealers have high-powered incentives. Winners may celebrate a lot and losers drown their sorrows. Low variance makes economists staid.
Oliver Hart,156,Harvard,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"A trade surplus means a country is saving, a trade deficit that it is dis-saving. As with people each can make sense at different times."
Oliver Hart,157,Harvard,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,The effects are hard to predict. US corporations might simply repatriate the profits and increase dividends or buy back shares.
Oliver Hart,158,Harvard,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"US corporations might invest more abroad rather than at home. But comanies might issue equity rather than borrowing, which would be good."
Oliver Hart,159,Harvard,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"If one party can make a take-it-or- leave-it offer to another party, a deal is often more likely than if bargaining occurs. But not always."
Oliver Hart,160,Harvard,7,5,Agree,Agree,Trade deals typically reduce barriers to trade which is likely to produce net gains to the U.S. ( although there can be winners and losers).
Oliver Hart,161,Harvard,10,6,Agree,Agree,Classic monopsonists reduce supply
Oliver Hart,162,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain, final prices rise. This doesn't describe Amazon.I don't know evidence that book supply is lower.
Oliver Hart,163,Harvard,5,7,Agree,Agree,I don't see evidence that consumers and authors are suffering. The market is fast-moving. Regulators should monitor but be cautious.
Oliver Hart,164,Harvard,5,6,Agree,Agree,"I would imagine there are many factors: labor-saving technology, globalization,the decline of unions,lower tax rates."
Oliver Hart,165,Harvard,2,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"I don't see any externalities. According to standard economics, competition enhances welfare and I believe that would be true here."
Oliver Hart,166,Harvard,9,7,Agree,Agree,The main uncertainty concerns whether Scotland retains the pound (bad idea) and stays in Europe( good idea). Once resolved things may be OK.
Oliver Hart,167,Harvard,9,6,Agree,Agree,I would say increase average welfare rather than income. There are surely many potential projects where the social benefit exceeds cost.
Oliver Hart,168,Harvard,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,Perhaps sometimes true in the past but I don't think it's inevitable. Projects like the interstate highways are notable exceptions.
Oliver Hart,169,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Many plans are defined benefit. These promise certain benefits, which should be discounted at the riskless interest rate not a higher rate."
Oliver Hart,170,Harvard,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Probably right. They should shift to defined contribution plans.
Oliver Hart,171,Harvard,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"I agree that energy cost should fall, which will increase U.S. competitiveness. The effects on growth are more subtle, and harder to predict"
Oliver Hart,172,Harvard,8,6,Agree,Agree,Given that wages/prices are sticky Keynesian-type stimulus will increase economic activity if the economy is not at full employment.
Oliver Hart,173,Harvard,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,Given that infrastructure expenditure was needed this was a good time to do it and so the benefits exceeded any costs.
Oliver Hart,174,Harvard,6,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,No rules would have allowed the Fed to act appropriately in the recent crisis. Better to choose governors well and give them discretion.
Oliver Hart,175,Harvard,8,6,Disagree,Uncertain,If patents are correctly granted trolls can encourage innovation. if patents are incorrectly granted trolls can impede innovation.
Oliver Hart,176,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Patents can encourage innovation. But many trivial software patents seem to be granted, which can discourage innovation and hurt consumers."
Oliver Hart,177,Harvard,4,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Consumers want liquid and safe securities. Firms' assets are often illiquid. Both sides can benefit if firms issue shares and senior debt.
Oliver Hart,178,Harvard,8,7,Agree,Uncertain,They would earm more if they did not discriminate unless their other workers are prejudiced. But they may survive anyway if they earn rents.
Oliver Hart,179,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Ths substitution effect goes this way, but the income effect can go in the opposite direction: with more income you can afford more children"
Oliver Hart,180,Harvard,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,Letting price vary with quality is good if there is enough competition. I don't know if that's true here. If not the answer is less clear.
Oliver Hart,181,Harvard,10,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"These econonomies still in bad shape. Bond yields high, but Investors may be exuberant and overestimating chance of future bailouts."
Oliver Hart,182,Harvard,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Since the stakes are high, the incentive to pay top athletes a lot is strong. Preserving equity among students is a small mitigating force."
Oliver Hart,183,Harvard,10,8,Uncertain,Agree,"My sense is that economic sanctions were important in ending apartheid in South Africa, and are leading Iran to negotiate with the West."
Oliver Hart,184,Harvard,10,7,Disagree,Disagree,I'd like to see it but I'm not sure the public is ready. Also would insurance cover this? Would people be able to top up (presumably)?
Oliver Hart,185,Harvard,8,5,Agree,Agree,"There has been temporary displacement but displaced workers have found jobs elsewhere, as theory might predict"
Oliver Hart,186,Harvard,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Unskilled jobs have been lost which may well be a factor, although not the only one, behind stagant median income and increasing inequality"
Oliver Hart,187,Harvard,10,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Economists are bad at predicting the far future. Technological advances have been amazing in the last few years and anything is possible.

Richard Schmalensee,279,MIT,7,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Seeks to prevent prices from clearing markets
Richard Schmalensee,280,MIT,7,5,Agree,Agree, never a good thing. Standard is hopelessly vague so increases risk for affected businesses.

Richard Thaler,106,Chicago,5,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,

Richard Thaler,126,Chicago,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,.25 bps doesn't matter much either way. It is the slope that matters. Go slow I say.
Richard Thaler,127,Chicago,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,Congress gave them no choice. We should have been borrowing at negative r and building infrastructure. And no inflation in sight.
Richard Thaler,128,Chicago,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,Recent working paper says yes. http://bit.ly/1HgC0lg

Richard Thaler,143,Chicago,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,Cost of waiting too long < cost of shooting too soon. Those predicting imminent inflation have been wrong for years.
Richard Thaler,144,Chicago,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,I don't see how anyone can have an opinion about this without data. A $1 tax break is worth it. $100B not. In between?
Richard Thaler,145,Chicago,1,5,Disagree,Disagree,Again data would be nice. Competition is good but unraveling is bad. Which is this? Transparency would help.

Richard Thaler,147,Chicago,1,7,Uncertain,Agree,Costs increase with the opt out rate. It would be possible to increase the vaccination rate short of a mandate by making opting out harder.

Richard Thaler,149,Chicago,5,9,Agree,Strongly Agree,Of course this is right. But magnitudes matter a lot.
Richard Thaler,150,Chicago,5,6,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,"In most cases we know very little. Chetty et al Danish study finds tax effects explain 1% of saving, design 99%."
Richard Thaler,151,Chicago,3,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"If done honestly, maybe, but the temptation to tilt would be strong. It is the rare tax cut that increases tax revenues."

Richard Thaler,154,Chicago,4,5,Disagree,Disagree,When the chooser is not the user then bad outcomes are common. My views are captured here: http://bit.ly/1Cql4mR

Richard Thaler,163,Chicago,1,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Too vague to answer. What sort of regulation? By whom?
Richard Thaler,164,Chicago,NA,6,No Opinion,Disagree,A bug in the system prevents me from stating that I am 100% sure that I don't know the answer to this question.
Richard Thaler,165,Chicago,4,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"But Uber needs to be careful about surge pricing in emergencies, people care about fairness as much as efficiency."

Richard Thaler,181,Chicago,1,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,I thought we had learned the lesson that low interest rates do not assure low risk.
Richard Thaler,182,Chicago,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Pay would go up for stars, unless the schools could collude, as they do now. More interesting question: should the athletes be paid? Yes"
Richard Thaler,183,Chicago,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,"I don't trust my memory to run a mental regression with sanctions on the right hand side. In principle, there should be sanctions that work"
Richard Thaler,184,Chicago,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,How should we incorporate the fact that nearly all non-economists hate this idea? Do we declare them wrong and proceed?
Richard Thaler,185,Chicago,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,
Richard Thaler,186,Chicago,NA,6,No Opinion,Uncertain,
Richard Thaler,187,Chicago,NA,6,No Opinion,Uncertain,I don't know how anyone could have any confidence in this sort of prediction. Good that no one can be proven wrong.

Richard Thaler,189,Chicago,5,8,Uncertain,Agree,Uber's ability to increase supply in the short run appears small so price increase may be mostly a transfer to Uber.

Richard Thaler,207,Chicago,7,6,Agree,Agree,The current system stinks. Why subsidize contribtions mostly of rich home-owners? Either kill it or make it a % credit that applies to all.
Richard Thaler,208,Chicago,4,6,Agree,Agree,
Richard Thaler,209,Chicago,3,7,Agree,Agree,"Yes I suppose so, but what of it?"
Richard Thaler,210,Chicago,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Poor question. Trade deals are negotiated. The word ""refusing"" is an odd choice."
Richard Thaler,211,Chicago,1,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,"If the question is whether the average is less than the max, then not interesting. And no idea how to interpret ""much"". Right Q: is NPV>0"

Richard Thaler,214,Chicago,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"This is a no brainer. You can't be serious about ""job creators"" without supporting reform here."
Richard Thaler,215,Chicago,NA,6,No Opinion,Agree,
Richard Thaler,216,Chicago,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,The debt ceiling is a dumb idea with no benefits and potentially catestrophic costs if ever used.
Richard Thaler,217,Chicago,4,6,Disagree,Disagree,Maybe I am missing something but I see no particular reason why this sector should be favored.
Richard Thaler,218,Chicago,1,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Hard to say without knowing about healthcare costs.
Richard Thaler,219,Chicago,8,7,Agree,Agree,Great on effiency but not on progressivity so you have to get that right elsewhere.
Richard Thaler,220,Chicago,8,7,Agree,Agree,arithmetic
Richard Thaler,221,Chicago,7,7,Agree,Agree,"ditto. Real issue should be to abolish the 10 year window and especially misleading attempts to disguise things via ""temporary"" tax cuts."
Richard Thaler,222,Chicago,6,6,Agree,Agree,Many details could have been improved but you could do nothing.
Richard Thaler,223,Chicago,7,6,Agree,Agree,There was no private money available.
Richard Thaler,224,Chicago,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,
Richard Thaler,225,Chicago,5,6,Agree,Agree,Seems right. Like the tax idea at rate that increases above some threshold.
Richard Thaler,226,Chicago,3,5,Agree,Agree,
Richard Thaler,227,Chicago,1,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"This or any other ""industrial policy"" is only as good as the implementation."
Richard Thaler,228,Chicago,1,6,Uncertain,Agree,Again impossible to say without details. Would prefer lower tax rate and broader tax.
Richard Thaler,229,Chicago,3,6,Agree,Agree,"Of course, there is no such thing as a risk free lunch."
Richard Thaler,230,Chicago,7,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,"This one is more substantive. It is like changing from an indexed DB plan to a nominal DC plan. Worse, adds risks that states default!"
Richard Thaler,231,Chicago,3,8,Agree,Agree,Agree. More generally too much weight is given to the jobs numbers. How about if we evaluate a president by the return on the stock market
Richard Thaler,232,Chicago,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"See Romney, Mitt."

Richard Thaler,247,Chicago,3,5,Uncertain,Agree,Hard to know without more details. The no brainer is to require better disclosure. You should have asked about that.
Richard Thaler,248,Chicago,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,
Richard Thaler,249,Chicago,1,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,Not sure about this policy. Would be very confusing to investors who (wrongly) think of these as bank accounts rather than investments.
Richard Thaler,250,Chicago,3,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Seems like this could ENCOURAGE runs.
Richard Thaler,251,Chicago,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Bad question. Taxes unlikely to work if low but big cigarette takes reduce consumption and peoplle don't substitute other smoke!
Richard Thaler,252,Chicago,6,7,Agree,Agree,Seems right to level the playing field.
Richard Thaler,253,Chicago,8,5,Agree,Agree,"Both prix fixe and a la carte have their place. But to paraphrase Mark Knofler, I want my, I want my, I want my Daily Show."
Richard Thaler,254,Chicago,7,8,Agree,Agree,Arithmetic. And too unlikely that Congress will find cuts elsewhere such as farm and oil subsidies and DoD.

Richard Thaler,268,Chicago,5,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Not needed. Big firms hold prices firm. ""Entrepreneurs"" with trucks help meet supply. Are the latter covered? If so, bad."
Richard Thaler,269,Chicago,8,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,Of course mixed strategy is better. Most of what TSA does is just barn door closing or for show. Reinforcing the cockpit door did a lot.
Richard Thaler,270,Chicago,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,

Richard Thaler,280,Chicago,6,6,Agree,Agree,Pharmacists must be the most underemployed professionals. Lots of schooling to count pills. In France they actually do stuff.
Richard Thaler,281,Chicago,8,5,Strongly Agree,Agree,"If Bob Shiller had succeeded in making it possible to short real estate markets, some of the bubbles might have been abated."
Richard Thaler,282,Chicago,7,7,Agree,Agree,Even clearer by 2011. Why ask about 2010 when much of the stimulus is slow acting? The stimulus project on my way to work just finishing.
Richard Thaler,283,Chicago,8,6,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,The part of the economy where we are still losing jobs is gov employment. Gov can create its own recession by being short sighted.
Richard Thaler,284,Chicago,3,6,Disagree,Disagree,Next questions: does the sun revolve around the earth.
Richard Thaler,285,Chicago,4,4,Agree,Uncertain,2 Reasons: 1. Winner's curse. 2 asymetric payoffs (CEO wins when things go well and does not suffer when things go sour. Combo = overpay.
Richard Thaler,286,Chicago,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,More transparency is good. Better would be to require disclosure of the process consultants use to set pay. Benchmarking is anit market.
Richard Thaler,287,Chicago,3,7,Uncertain,Agree,Compared to what? More than 1% have good tech skills. Education disparities and tax policies surely more important.

Richard Thaler,289,Chicago,7,9,Agree,Strongly Agree,
Richard Thaler,290,Chicago,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Of course the use of the tax revenue is key. Question: why do no GOP candidates favor such policies? Answer: more anti tax than pro market
Richard Thaler,291,Chicago,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Since a carbon tax is politically infeasible how about hiking the gas tax by a dollar and then index it. We now have a negative carbon tax.
Richard Thaler,292,Chicago,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,A test of whether the panel is awake.
Richard Thaler,293,Chicago,10,5,Strongly Agree,Agree,War on drugs dumber than invading Iraq in search of WMDs. Treat pot like booze. Would also lower prison population.

Richard Thaler,305,Chicago,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Only a small part of the puzzle. Tax reform anyone?
Richard Thaler,306,Chicago,NA,4,No Opinion,Disagree,Not a monetary economist. No idea.
Robert Hall,1,Stanford,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Current inflation is still a bit below target, when the validation of past forward guidance would call for keeping it above 2 percent."
Robert Hall,2,Stanford,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"After more than a decade of inflation below target, only a die-hard believer would be confident that the Fed can raise inflation at will."
Robert Hall,3,Stanford,7,7,Agree,Disagree,The president should support the Fed's interest-rate policy when it focuses on hitting a reasonable target for unemployment and inflation
Robert Hall,4,Stanford,9,6,Uncertain,Agree,"The Fed should stand ready to loan to a bank on reliable collateral, even if the bank is insolvent and subject to orderly resolution."
Robert Hall,5,Stanford,2,5,Uncertain,Agree,Medical debt is a complicated issue and I lack the professional background to have an opinion
Robert Hall,6,Stanford,2,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"The specification of the policy change said nothing about what prices the gov would pay for drugs, so this is a an unanswerable question."
Robert Hall,7,Stanford,2,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"It would probably be an improvement for a segment of the population, but I don't have the expertise to determine if it would be a majority."
Robert Hall,8,Stanford,5,6,Agree,Agree,This does not mean that it is a good idea
Robert Hall,9,Stanford,8,5,Uncertain,Agree,There's nothing optimal about allocating medical care by wasteful waiting.

Robert Hall,12,Stanford,9,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Some would gain and some would lose—payday loans are not all harmful
Robert Hall,13,Stanford,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,True for US monetary policy. The main big outside event that might create such a serious problem for monetary policy is a flu epidemic
Robert Hall,14,Stanford,4,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Dodd-Frank gave us the tools to achieve financial stability,so, if we use them, we are not at risk from climate change or other disturbances"

Robert Hall,19,Stanford,2,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Resentment from a belief that other people are benefiting from government programs is part of populism
Robert Hall,20,Stanford,2,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,We don't know what those would be
Robert Hall,21,Stanford,4,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,This depends on the effectiveness of laws and regulations limiting harmful conduct by corporations.

Robert Hall,24,Stanford,2,5,Uncertain,Agree,Possibly tulip mania?
Robert Hall,25,Stanford,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,"Justification is not a relevant concept in the economics of wage determination. Wages depend on a variety of forces, some bad and some OK"
Robert Hall,26,Stanford,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,That is not to say that such a policy is the best way to deal with malignant sources of depressed earnings of women
Robert Hall,27,Stanford,3,8,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Macro policy does affect external flows, but lots of other things matter too."

Robert Hall,31,Stanford,NA,6,No Opinion,Agree,"Depends on the measure of incidence--see question b. US is richest in world, so incidence is likely to be smaller."
Robert Hall,32,Stanford,6,5,Agree,Agree,True almost by definition. Prosperous people are better able to handle any economic change.
Robert Hall,33,Stanford,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,The obvious danger is an unwise monetary expansion timed to win an election.
Robert Hall,34,Stanford,8,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Total capacity of elite higher ed is endogenous, so a limit on favoritism to donors would cut capacity as well as allocating it to top kids."
Robert Hall,35,Stanford,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,One could also think about the much larger effect of the big fraction of capacity allocated to athletes.
Robert Hall,36,Stanford,5,5,Agree,Agree,
Robert Hall,37,Stanford,7,5,Uncertain,Agree,
Robert Hall,38,Stanford,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,We should focus on a progressive consumption tax structured as a value-added tax.

Robert Hall,40,Stanford,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"""Anti-competitive"" is a meaningless term. Policy on big platforms needs to be guided by serious consideration of social welfare."
Robert Hall,41,Stanford,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"An analysis would require consideration of the incentives to create new dominant platforms, which would obviously be impaired by regulation."
Robert Hall,42,Stanford,10,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Governments cannot create money under current monetary institutions, because the central bank keeps reserves and currency at par"

Robert Hall,50,Stanford,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Talented and trained people make much higher incomes in the US than in Europe, and health care is human-capital intensive."

Robert Hall,52,Stanford,1,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Cap and trade creates rents that could otherwise be tax revenue
Robert Hall,53,Stanford,3,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Yes, if you mean that Af(x) has increasing returns in A and x. Not restricted to market economies. Generation, copy of ideas is important."

Robert Hall,58,Stanford,8,7,Agree,Agree,It's hard to think of a worse idea for a central bank than asking it to control productivity growth. Promoters have forgotten King Canute.
Robert Hall,59,Stanford,7,4,Agree,Disagree,"The EC's main objective is to hobble American companies. The GE-Honeywell merger denial is an example, a beneficial merger of complements."

Robert Hall,69,Stanford,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,The US remains the most attractive place for innovators. No change in appeal for foreigners. But possibly harder for them to enter.
Robert Hall,70,Stanford,3,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Conceptually, the fundamental value is the present value of its transaction services. Depends on competition in the private currency mkt"
Robert Hall,71,Stanford,9,5,Disagree,Uncertain,The price of a security is not a random walk--it is derived from its dividend (transaction services) and the asset-pricing kernel.
Robert Hall,72,Stanford,7,6,Agree,Agree,True even with appropriate policy.
Robert Hall,73,Stanford,8,7,Uncertain,Agree,"This question seems to presume that the government tells people when to retire, rather than providing a framework where they can decide."
Robert Hall,74,Stanford,9,6,Disagree,Uncertain,Certainly not if it is interpreted as a fixed u*. We now know that unemployment dynamics following a major shock are complicated.
Robert Hall,75,Stanford,9,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Until the next shock occurs, unemployment will continue to drift downward. The u rate in 1999 in MSP was 0.9 percent without dysfunction."
Robert Hall,76,Stanford,3,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Though there is merit in cutting the corp tax and other capital taxes, with no other changes in policy, the fed gov will collapse."
Robert Hall,77,Stanford,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Spending is on a relentless increase relative to revenue. Within 10 years, the fed gov will lose access to credit."
Robert Hall,78,Stanford,6,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"In principle, an optimizing government runs a deficit to smooth taxes when a recession occurs. That's no excuse for the current deficit."
Robert Hall,79,Stanford,6,5,Agree,Disagree,"The gov is way down the path of disappearance of a market for its debt, with the highest peacetime deficit/GDP ever."
Robert Hall,80,Stanford,6,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"This type of behavior is common for isolated decisions, such as taking out a mortgage. People do better with frequently-made decisions."

Robert Hall,83,Stanford,4,7,Agree,Agree,There are already some bad signs about the shrinking labor force. Those not in the LF are unhappy and inclined to opiods.

Robert Hall,126,Stanford,9,5,Disagree,Uncertain,The Fed has somewhat overstated the current level of the natural unemployment rate and fails to understand that it is falling.
Robert Hall,127,Stanford,10,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"The Fed's job is to stabilize inflation, barring significant inflationary shocks, and inflation continues to run below any reasonable target"
Robert Hall,128,Stanford,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,There's almost no support for short-term-ism. And earnings numbers themselves are unimportant. The market values overall prospects.
Robert Hall,129,Stanford,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Public markets need certified disclosure regimes. Businesses that are harmed by disclosure should be private.
Robert Hall,130,Stanford,1,5,Agree,Agree,An heavily fact-related issue in an area I'm not well informed about.
Robert Hall,131,Stanford,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Thanks to products from advanced countries, poor countries have had huge improvements in longevity without much income growth."

Robert Hall,133,Stanford,3,6,Disagree,Disagree,The ACA caved to demands for excessively broad coverage.
Robert Hall,134,Stanford,3,6,Disagree,Agree,The expansion of coverage was mainly intended to bring in healthy people whose payments would exceed their medical costs.
Robert Hall,135,Stanford,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Depends on how many exceptions are allowed. Most $15 city min wages exempt union members, for example."
Robert Hall,136,Stanford,8,5,Disagree,Disagree,Does anybody have a mechanism in mind that would raise output? Stigler's argument that a min wage might not harm employment does not support
Robert Hall,137,Stanford,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,Even better would be an immediate debt writeoff coupled with a new relation to the eurosystem that blocked further access to credit.
Robert Hall,138,Stanford,2,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Optimal tariff theory says that countries should raise their prices. So policies to lower prices by devaluing must be harmful.
Robert Hall,139,Stanford,3,5,Disagree,Disagree,Most Americans benefit because of lower prices of imports. Some lose because they are employed in industries competing with the devaluer.
Robert Hall,140,Stanford,5,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,Just being aware that others are solving similar problems doesn't lead to the successes economists have had. Rather it is Nash equilibrium.
Robert Hall,141,Stanford,3,7,Disagree,Agree,Lots of real growth in the top deciles and the bottom deciles. Not so clear at the median.
Robert Hall,142,Stanford,4,7,Uncertain,Agree,There would be winners and losers. A better policy would engineer a roughly Pareto improving change. Bu probably better than nothing.

Robert Hall,149,Stanford,9,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,The only possible question is the magnitude.
Robert Hall,150,Stanford,4,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"A lot depends on the response of monetary policy, and there is no agreement on how much policy should or does respond to output changes."
Robert Hall,151,Stanford,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Again, the response of other elements of policy, monetary and fiscal, needs to be factored in, and there is great uncertainty."

Robert Hall,153,Stanford,8,7,Agree,Agree,...to a person who was unaware of the resale market (not me!)
Robert Hall,154,Stanford,5,5,Agree,Disagree,"Provided one takes a broad view of supply and demand--printed books are a sunset product, and thus pricey."
Robert Hall,155,Stanford,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"The 1986 decline had little effect on real GDP. Oil prices don't shift production functions. Real income rises, but not real output."
Robert Hall,156,Stanford,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Those dealers know how to have fun...
Robert Hall,157,Stanford,6,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Focusing on trade is basically mercantilism. I take a global perspective, where trade always nets to zero, so this focus is meaningless."

Robert Hall,178,Stanford,3,6,Agree,Agree,Depends on some subtle issues. Discrimination may results mainly in segregation under some conditions.
Robert Hall,179,Stanford,3,6,Uncertain,Agree,Certainly this is not a theorem--it depends on preferences and technology-- income versus substitution effects.
Robert Hall,180,Stanford,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,This is a total side issue. The central issue is the perennial last-mile problem--the market power of the cable and phone companies.

Robert Hall,202,Stanford,8,7,Agree,Agree,Only an unlikely exotic economy could over come the basic principle that more now means less later.
Robert Hall,203,Stanford,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"I would have said ""Slavery was abolished because it was morally deeply wrong, not because it was in the owners' interest to free slaves"""
Robert Hall,204,Stanford,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Totally basic economics--gains from trade
Robert Hall,205,Stanford,8,6,Uncertain,Agree,Serious overspending currently on rail. Roads and bridges need user charges. Not many true public goods that call for higher spending.
Robert Hall,206,Stanford,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"True for rail. For other infrastructure, the main problem is not the spending, but rather the failure to impose appropriate user charges."
Robert Hall,207,Stanford,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,Some but hardly all charitable giving generates public goods and thus relieves distortions. We should keep the good deductions only.
Robert Hall,208,Stanford,8,6,Agree,Agree,"In principle, production cost puts a ceiling on its value, but there is no floor. No protection from competition, unlike the dollar."
Robert Hall,209,Stanford,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Simple math...interesting that it has not happened to Japan, however."
Robert Hall,210,Stanford,7,5,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,Policymakers seem to think that granting the right to export to the US is a valuable privilege that comes at some cost to the US.
Robert Hall,211,Stanford,1,4,Uncertain,Uncertain,"If we used the gov funds to propagate the most highly touted programs, wouldn't we get a good result? But I don't have any expertise here."
Robert Hall,212,Stanford,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,I'm aware that some fairly clean natural experiments have not found effects.
Robert Hall,213,Stanford,4,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"The benefits go to the somewhat more skilled at the expense of the lowest, which does not seem to be desirable policy."
Robert Hall,214,Stanford,3,7,Uncertain,Agree,"The big issue in immigration is the families of the workers. Almost any worker is a benefit, but the other family members may be costly."
Robert Hall,215,Stanford,7,6,Disagree,Agree,"Central banks lose control of the price level at the zero lower bound, when their reserves become close substitutes for government debt."
Robert Hall,216,Stanford,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,This is a question about the behavior of members of Congress. I don't see how an economist could have any expertise on this.

Robert Hall,221,Stanford,5,7,Agree,Agree,Rationalizing Medicare and bringing contributions for higher-income families into line with benefits would be a good idea on its own.
Robert Hall,222,Stanford,5,6,Disagree,Agree,Not compared to an ideal policy of an orderly reorganization imposing losses on creditors according to seniority. But better than chaotic.
Robert Hall,223,Stanford,6,6,Disagree,Agree,"Again, it would have been better to reorganize with suitable losses on the junior creditors. This would not have resulted in higher unemp."
Robert Hall,224,Stanford,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,See previous answer
Robert Hall,225,Stanford,8,6,Disagree,Agree,Limiting assets is largely ineffective because banks can take similar risks and earn similar returns using swaps rather than holding assets.
Robert Hall,226,Stanford,7,5,Agree,Agree,"Any returns to scale are likely exhausted at smaller scale. But we should not measure size by assets, but by exposure."
Robert Hall,227,Stanford,4,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Tremendously complicated. Many US manufactured goods have high profit margins, so correcting the distortion would help us and others"
Robert Hall,228,Stanford,8,6,Agree,Agree,"Nordhaus has shown how much leakage of ideas occurs into the worldwide public domain. Of course, the US would capture only a quarter of gain"
Robert Hall,229,Stanford,4,6,Uncertain,Agree,"It seems unlikely that such serious cutbacks would ever occur. The risk is to the government's fiscal position, not to US health."
Robert Hall,230,Stanford,4,6,Uncertain,Agree,"So, of course, premium support in lieu of Medicare would be raised. Again the risk is to fiscal, not medical, health."
Robert Hall,231,Stanford,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,No doubt about this whatsoever!
Robert Hall,232,Stanford,6,7,Disagree,Agree,"Apart from the issue of carried interest, this is not a big issue in taxation."
Robert Hall,233,Stanford,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,Mirrlees-type arguments for taxation of the return to capital involve a sacrifice of the total size of the pot to bring about redistribution
Robert Hall,234,Stanford,9,7,Agree,Agree,The key parameter is the elasticity of substitution in the social welfare function across people. We don't agree on that.
Robert Hall,235,Stanford,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,This is a big problem with corporate pensions too.

Robert Hall,253,Stanford,7,5,Agree,Agree,Bundling is the natural pricing model with fairly homogeneous preferences. Consumers with low values would gain from unbundling.
Robert Hall,254,Stanford,8,8,Agree,Agree,Rationalization is a better term than cuts. Equal health outcomes are possible with much less spending.
Robert Hall,255,Stanford,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Although the ideal regime to bring discipline to economic policies of the southern Euro countries would be self-reliance, conditions are 2nd"
Robert Hall,256,Stanford,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Seems like Europe and Germany are in for bad times no matter what. There's no way Germany could bail out everything.
Robert Hall,257,Stanford,7,6,Disagree,Agree,"We should care about Greece and apply tough love for its own sake, not just the stability of other countries."
Robert Hall,258,Stanford,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"The government has to satisfy its budget constraint, so one can't say anything about a tax cut without knowing what else happens."

Robert Hall,262,Stanford,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Higher ed is like other human-service-intensive activities, bound to become more expensive relative to goods production.No special force."
Robert Hall,263,Stanford,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,All macro models agree that lower product demand and higher taxes reduce current output and employment.
Robert Hall,264,Stanford,7,5,Agree,Disagree,"More important, it raises real income and thus consumption. We don't really care about exports, only consumer well-being."
Robert Hall,265,Stanford,4,6,Agree,Agree,"That is, with free-market policies and honest competent government, a Caribbean country could prosper without US trade or tourists."
Robert Hall,266,Stanford,8,7,Uncertain,Agree,Solow explained why a level effect does not affect growth. We don't really know much about debt determination in the longer run.
Robert Hall,267,Stanford,4,6,Agree,Disagree,"Labor demand determines total hours, so as long as the legal constraint binds, tightening it raises employment.Does not make it a good idea."
Robert Hall,268,Stanford,3,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Goal is to allocate suddenly scarce goods optimally. Prices are only a tool, but often the right tool. Law doesn't have a good alternative."
Robert Hall,269,Stanford,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,"I don't think economists have any professional expertise in this area. Anti-terrorist policy should be evidence-based, not Aristotelian."

Robert Hall,294,Stanford,7,6,Agree,Agree,Zero real GDP growth and huge outstanding debt make the deficit growth high even though Italy has a small primary surplus.
Robert Hall,295,Stanford,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,"This is a question about Italian politics where I'm no expert, but progress so far in lowering real wages and improving TFP has been small."

Robert Hall,304,Stanford,3,8,Uncertain,Agree,The problem with cashing out public support of education is that parents are the agents of children and some parents are poor agents.
Robert Hall,305,Stanford,5,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Close call. Depends on enforcement efforts. Prior to 1986, taxpayers in the high bracket seemed to be willing to buy inefficient shelters."
