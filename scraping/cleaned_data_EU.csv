Franklin Allen,1,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Depends what the money is spent on. Germany is probably underinvesting in infrastructure and education.
Franklin Allen,2,Imperial College London,5,7,Disagree,Agree,Again it depends on what the money is being spent on with the expanded fiscal policy relative to what is the optimal public expenditure.
Franklin Allen,3,Imperial College London,5,8,Disagree,Agree,Not clear in the long run that policy interventions of this kind are beneficial. Again depends on how productively spending is.
Franklin Allen,4,Imperial College London,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,There are a lot of opportunities building new businesses from the climate change initiative. The time horizon is long enough for it to be ok
Franklin Allen,5,Imperial College London,3,6,Uncertain,Agree,This is an interesting question. I do not know the research in this area well.
Franklin Allen,6,Imperial College London,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,In the short run there may be negative effects unless there is a long lead in time. In the long run it will help climate change.
Franklin Allen,7,Imperial College London,7,7,Agree,Disagree,Investment has been low since the Brexit vote. Now there is more clarity after the election it should increase.
Franklin Allen,8,Imperial College London,6,7,Agree,Agree,The law outlawing extension appears to be a negotiating strategy. There is a risk that they don't the deal.
Franklin Allen,9,Imperial College London,5,7,Disagree,Agree,I think there is likely to be a negative short term effect but in the medium and long term it is not clear what will happen.

Franklin Allen,11,Imperial College London,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,
Franklin Allen,12,Imperial College London,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,It depends significantly on the country and what exactly the money would be spent on in both public and private cases.
Franklin Allen,13,Imperial College London,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,Private research tends to spent on rich world lifestyle medical problems while public research can focus on deadly diseases like TB.
Franklin Allen,14,Imperial College London,8,7,Agree,Agree,RCTs are a very good way in certain circumstances to establish whether certain business strategies and public policies are beneficial.
Franklin Allen,15,Imperial College London,8,7,Agree,Agree,They can help identify the uses for new technologies and how they can best be implemented.
Franklin Allen,16,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,I think the issue of stakeholder governance is a very important and much understudied subject. It has been difficult to publish papers.
Franklin Allen,17,Imperial College London,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Again very understudied.
Franklin Allen,18,Imperial College London,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,I think it will be very difficult to do in practice. The German system of codetermination may be better.

Franklin Allen,21,Imperial College London,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,
Franklin Allen,22,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,It is probably close to the limits of what it can achieve using previous tools. But there may be new ones they can come up with.
Franklin Allen,23,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Maybe in the short run but in the long run good investment decisions associated with innovation are likely to have more effect.
Franklin Allen,24,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,It depends on the circumstances of the country. If it is not very indebted and public investment would be beneficial then it makes sense.
Franklin Allen,25,Imperial College London,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Competence is clearly extremely important. However, in a severe Eurozone crisis understanding key countries' position may also be important"
Franklin Allen,26,Imperial College London,6,8,Uncertain,Agree,"If all the positions were held by male northern Europeans, it would not be good for the democratic legitimacy of the Union."
Franklin Allen,27,Imperial College London,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"For 5G, high speed trains, etc., Chinese technology is better than European, US or Japanese. It would be a shame for Euope not to use it."
Franklin Allen,28,Imperial College London,7,8,Agree,Agree,"The doom loop is a real problem still, particularly for some southern European countries."
Franklin Allen,29,Imperial College London,7,8,Agree,Agree,I think this would be helpful.
Franklin Allen,30,Imperial College London,7,8,Uncertain,Uncertain,It would be interesting to see exactly what the political opposition would be to this measure.
Franklin Allen,31,Imperial College London,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Disagree,
Franklin Allen,32,Imperial College London,5,8,Uncertain,Agree,"Theoretically it can go both ways as deposit insurance can increase risk taking. Empirically there is some evidence crises can increase.
-see background information here"
Franklin Allen,33,Imperial College London,6,8,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,"Complicated issue because of the effect of deposit insurance on risk taking.
-see background information here"
Franklin Allen,34,Imperial College London,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,It's difficult issue involving both funding of public goods and inequality issues.
Franklin Allen,35,Imperial College London,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Ascertaining the optimal level is again very difficult.
Franklin Allen,36,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Disagree,I would say it depends on the extent of global competition and the amount of access to EU markets.
Franklin Allen,37,Imperial College London,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,Again it depends on global versus local competition.
Franklin Allen,38,Imperial College London,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,This is an interesting trade-off. I'm afraid I am not up on the literature enough to express a meaningful opinion.
Franklin Allen,39,Imperial College London,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,This is an interesting trade-off. I am afraid I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about this to give a meaningful opinion.
Franklin Allen,40,Imperial College London,4,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Not sure of the entire literature in this field. Would guess there are a range of results here.
Franklin Allen,41,Imperial College London,5,5,Agree,Agree,Not very knowledgeable about the current ESG policies of Norwegian Global Pension fund.
Franklin Allen,42,Imperial College London,5,6,Disagree,Uncertain,There are arguments both ways. Not fully persuaded either way.
Franklin Allen,43,Imperial College London,6,7,Agree,Agree,Italy has significant fiscal problems. They need to get their debt under control.
Franklin Allen,44,Imperial College London,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,France's fiscal situation is still under control. The problem is the effect on the Commission's interaction with Italy.
Franklin Allen,45,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Complicated issue with many factors involved including price, convenience, availability, safety, and so forth,"
Franklin Allen,46,Imperial College London,7,8,Agree,Agree,Taxing road use is is good way of dealing with congestion. Main downside is income distribution so could use revenues for public transport.
Franklin Allen,47,Imperial College London,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,I'm not well informed about the demographics of all EU immigrants in the time period considered. Usually immigrants provide net benefits.
Franklin Allen,48,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Not exactly sure what the question is suggesting.
Franklin Allen,49,Imperial College London,7,7,Agree,Agree,The lags in terms of the effects of policy are uncertain and probably highly variable. It seems unlikely that voters understand this well.
Franklin Allen,50,Imperial College London,4,5,Disagree,Disagree,Autonomous cars may take some time before they are widely used.
Franklin Allen,51,Imperial College London,7,8,Agree,Agree,"As far as I know, there's not much evidence that central bank policies are very effective in affecting productivity."
Franklin Allen,52,Imperial College London,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,The digital companies need to be taxed. This seems the best way to do it that I have heard.
Franklin Allen,53,Imperial College London,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,Profits are fairly meaningless for these companies since they can use accounting charges to move the profits to very low tax rate places.
Franklin Allen,54,Imperial College London,3,6,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,I would say the evidence is mixed and I do not enough about it to draw a reasonable conclusion.
Franklin Allen,55,Imperial College London,7,8,Agree,Agree,"By and large, I agree with free trade. The question is well phrased to avoid some of the downsides of free trade."
Franklin Allen,56,Imperial College London,7,7,Agree,Agree,"In the short run this is often true. In the medium and long term, it's more difficult to say. Retraining is not that successful so far."
Franklin Allen,57,Imperial College London,6,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Contrary to what President Trump said, outcomes of trade wars are difficult to predict but are probably not good for anybody."
Franklin Allen,58,Imperial College London,7,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,I would say there is a great deal of uncertainty about this with much depending on how things develop in the Eurozone in the coming years.
Franklin Allen,59,Imperial College London,6,7,Agree,Disagree,It has suffered a punishing depression and has only recently started growing. It would have grown much faster outside the Eurozone.
Franklin Allen,60,Imperial College London,7,7,Agree,Agree,It would have removed the debt overhang and could have grown much faster as a result.
Franklin Allen,61,Imperial College London,6,7,Agree,Disagree,At the moment Bitcoin is more of an investment than a medium of exchange and so is closer to gold. The reason is the price volatility.
Franklin Allen,62,Imperial College London,6,6,Agree,Disagree,"I think Bitcoin is not necessarily a bubble since it does have uses, eg, transferring value from Venezuela to the US."
Franklin Allen,63,Imperial College London,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,
Franklin Allen,64,Imperial College London,8,7,Agree,Agree,Trump's election has put off many creative people who might otherwise be interested in moving to the US.

Franklin Allen,66,Imperial College London,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Strongly Disagree,
Franklin Allen,67,Imperial College London,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,I am not knowledgeable about the evidence in this area. Setting quotas is a good idea in my view but not because of value increase.
Franklin Allen,68,Imperial College London,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,I think there would be long term benefits of quotas for this kind of reason.
Franklin Allen,69,Imperial College London,6,6,Agree,Disagree,There seem to be strong learning by doing effects. Subsidies can help target these where these effects are largest.
Franklin Allen,70,Imperial College London,6,5,Agree,Disagree,The quicker we get up the learning curve for these technologies the better.
Franklin Allen,71,Imperial College London,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,Not so clear solar-power is the best alternative for Germany. I am afraid I don't know enough about the technologies and Germany's climate.
Franklin Allen,72,Imperial College London,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,I think this is true in many markets. In financial markets it may be less true because of the money at stake but they matter there too.
Franklin Allen,73,Imperial College London,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,I am not very well informed on the skill sets of the refugees that have been allowed to stay. In general I think immigration is beneficial.
Franklin Allen,74,Imperial College London,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,
Franklin Allen,75,Imperial College London,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,
Franklin Allen,76,Imperial College London,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,Uber provides a different kind of service to regular taxi services that helps consumers. Leck of worker's rights may be a problem though.
Franklin Allen,77,Imperial College London,5,7,Agree,Agree,This seems an area where competition would be beneficial.
Franklin Allen,78,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Trade-off of worker'w rights and consumers benefits is a difficult one.
Franklin Allen,79,Imperial College London,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Giving flexibility should improve things in the long run. The short run effects may be more problematic if there is a lot of dissent,"
Franklin Allen,80,Imperial College London,7,7,Agree,Agree,This seems to have been the case in other countries. The unions response may lead to a different outcome in the case of France.
Franklin Allen,81,Imperial College London,6,7,Uncertain,Agree,It's difficult to know the effect of these asset purchases on consumer price inflation.
Franklin Allen,82,Imperial College London,5,6,Disagree,Uncertain,It seems quite uncertain to me what the effect on growth of the asset purchases. It will depend among other things on how they are unwound
Franklin Allen,83,Imperial College London,8,9,Agree,Strongly Agree,"In the absence of inside information, on average a diversified strategy should do better unless the person has good judgment."
Franklin Allen,84,Imperial College London,7,7,Agree,Agree,It depends on how easy it is for them to keep working. The easier it is the less likely this scenario will unfold.
Franklin Allen,85,Imperial College London,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Yes, people need to work longer given the demographic distribution and increased longevity."
Franklin Allen,86,Imperial College London,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,There are huge agglomeration effects from having clusters of expertise.
Franklin Allen,87,Imperial College London,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Most other large European countries have higher social payments, taxes and more secure employment. Providing incentives is more difficult."
Franklin Allen,88,Imperial College London,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Italy's banks are significantly undercapitalized, particularly if you consider market rather than accounting capital."
Franklin Allen,89,Imperial College London,8,8,Agree,Agree,Shareholders and non-retail bondholders need to be penalised if a bank fails to provide the right incentives going forward.
Franklin Allen,90,Imperial College London,6,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"For many but not all industries, privatization increases efficiency. I think this is true in many central and eastern European countries."
Franklin Allen,91,Imperial College London,7,8,Agree,Agree,Free movement is a good thing economically and in many other ways.
Franklin Allen,92,Imperial College London,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,I think we are all better off from immigration.
Franklin Allen,93,Imperial College London,7,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Free trade increases the efficiency of the economy. Although there significant distributional issues, the average person is better off."
Franklin Allen,94,Imperial College London,5,7,Agree,Disagree,Some workers are made worse off but as consumers they are probably better off.
Franklin Allen,95,Imperial College London,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,These kinds of taxes are beneficial in my view provided the technology for implementing them is sufficiently low cost.
Franklin Allen,96,Imperial College London,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Difficult to answer such a general question - more information about the particular circumstances is required.
Franklin Allen,97,Imperial College London,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Small countries have an incentive to offer low rates since their fixed costs are smaller.
Franklin Allen,98,Imperial College London,5,8,Uncertain,Agree,It's very difficult to know how the negotiations for trade and immigration will play out. The benefits of being outside the EU are unclear.
Franklin Allen,99,Imperial College London,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Again very difficult to know how things will play out at this stage.

Hans-Joachim Voth,83,University of Zurich,9,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,
Hans-Joachim Voth,84,University of Zurich,5,7,Agree,Agree,The picture is mixed
Hans-Joachim Voth,85,University of Zurich,1,8,Strongly Agree,Agree," some cities have been captured by the taxi lobby, as in the US"
Hans-Joachim Voth,86,University of Zurich,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree," others boast cheap, safe, plentiful taxi services..."

Hans-Joachim Voth,88,University of Zurich,4,7,Uncertain,Agree,Modern labor econ overwhelmingly suggests that firms have a lot of market power

Hans-Joachim Voth,93,University of Zurich,3,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,this is a supposition that seems logical but empirical evidence seems weak in general
Hans-Joachim Voth,94,University of Zurich,4,7,Disagree,Disagree,The benefits for the finances of pay-as-you-go systems are fairly obvious...
Hans-Joachim Voth,95,University of Zurich,8,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,Wholesale financial services naturally congregate in a handful of locations....that's why there are financial centers in the first place.
Hans-Joachim Voth,96,University of Zurich,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,I think this is really secondary
Hans-Joachim Voth,97,University of Zurich,5,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree," ""light touch"" regulation and the lock-in from pre-existing activity are much more important."
Hans-Joachim Voth,98,University of Zurich,5,8,Agree,Agree,I think this could easily backfire. Bailouts done right can be a jolly goood thing but i have at least some reservations about the prospects
Hans-Joachim Voth,99,University of Zurich,3,7,Uncertain,Agree,There is already a lot of concern in Germany about EMU rules being broken. This could be the final straw
Hélène Rey,1,London Business School,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Investing now to tackle e.g climate change is prudent strategy instead of getting low returns on external assets. Low gvt borrowing rates.
Hélène Rey,2,London Business School,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,fiscal policy now would be effective to boost economy and invest for future. Would help constrained monetary policy.
Hélène Rey,3,London Business School,9,8,Agree,Agree,
Hélène Rey,4,London Business School,8,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"This all depends how we get there. If major EU coordinated investments, R&D and leadership role, costs will be mitigated"
Hélène Rey,5,London Business School,9,6,Agree,Agree,Best way is predictably rising carbon price path with redistribution of carbon dividend and accompanying investments
Hélène Rey,6,London Business School,8,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Depends on accompanying policies: technological transfers and aid to mitigate costs could help a lot.
Hélène Rey,7,London Business School,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"There is great uncertainty about the path that will be chosen, from no deal to soft Brexit."
Hélène Rey,8,London Business School,8,7,Agree,Agree,Short time to negotiate increases chances of no deal and of soft Brexit. Everything in between takes time to negotiate.
Hélène Rey,9,London Business School,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Most independent studies have shown large effects of no deal.
Hélène Rey,10,London Business School,8,6,Disagree,Uncertain,Climate related events can be supply (for some) or demand (for others) shocks. Some are transitory. They affect monetary policy.

Hélène Rey,21,London Business School,6,7,Uncertain,Agree,Depends on policy. Scrapping carbon tax to please Gilets Jaunes not a good policy.
Hélène Rey,22,London Business School,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,Has to prevent fall in inflationary expectations
Hélène Rey,23,London Business School,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Stimulate aggregate demand unless larger fiscal deficit mean higher risk premium in which case higher interest burden will decrease AD
Hélène Rey,24,London Business School,8,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,It depends on the country. At high debt level risk premium increase can more than undo aggregate demand stimulus

Hélène Rey,61,London Business School,8,7,Strongly Agree,Disagree,Net financing needed by Greece is small over that horizon.
Hélène Rey,62,London Business School,8,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,There would have been a major crisis with social distress and no institutional reforms.
Hélène Rey,63,London Business School,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,Greece was insolvent and an orderly default inside euro coupled with reforms would have been best.
Hélène Rey,64,London Business School,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Bitcoins lack characteristics of fiat money (legal tender, trust in issuing state, good store of value, good medium of exchange)"
Hélène Rey,65,London Business School,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Disagree,Gold has some durable intrinsic value (jewels). Bitcoins have none.

Hélène Rey,83,London Business School,NA,9,Did Not Answer,Strongly Agree,Short run effects would depend on when it is implemented. It would increase unemployment in a downturn.
Hélène Rey,84,London Business School,7,7,Agree,Agree,They ensured that no self -fulling vicious risk premium dynamics happen in periphery and appropriate loose monetary conditions remain.
Hélène Rey,85,London Business School,8,8,Agree,Agree,"If spreads diverge (self-fulfilling debt crisis) in peri[hery, restoring monetary policy tramsmission will be key."

Jan Pieter Krahnen,1,Goethe University Frankfurt,4,7,Uncertain,Agree,"If the EU is one economy, some countries will always run a surplus/deficit"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,2,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Uncertain,Agree, there is no point in balancing the current account by country.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,3,Goethe University Frankfurt,4,8,Uncertain,Agree,"There are pros and cons, as some countries have hard-to sustain government debt levels, others not. Thus, a case by case analysis is needed."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,4,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Fiscal policies in the Eurozone are by and large regional/national decisions, so coordination may be either not justified, or not needed."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,5,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,6,Disagree,Agree,"The policy will require significant public and private investments, allowing for knock-on effects that are likely to spur growth."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,6,Goethe University Frankfurt,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"The big difference is the ""cap"" - without it, taxes may distort investment and consumption, but will not necessarily reduce emissions."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,7,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Agree,Disagree,The question leaves open whether or not the border tax is accompanied by higher levies for CO2 production within borders.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,8,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Disagree,Agree,"The demise of the ""fork"" (in versus out) reduces ambiguity greatly, allowing longer term planning once again."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,9,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"I don't thing that the EU on the other side of the table will play hard ball - they will rather give in, allowing for a trade arrangement."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,10,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,This is too complicated a case to think it through properly now.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,11,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"The answer is ""uncertain"", because I fear political pressure combined with central bank hubris may lead to action based on a false positive"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,12,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,
Jan Pieter Krahnen,13,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"I believe in the direct plus indirect benefit of basic research, which is more likely to be public rather than private R&D."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,14,Goethe University Frankfurt,4,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Public R&D may have positive second round effects in the form of private R&D, whereas the opposite is less likely to happen."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,15,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Agree,Agree,"This is an overall YES, because it addresses directly the identification problem, thereby hinting at effective policy instruments."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,16,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Disagree,Uncertain,The fact that I learn something about causality does not imply implementing isolated changes (of instruments) in the real world is easy.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,17,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,There is a route to maximizing shareholder value while simultaneously upholding stakeholder utility: That is German Ordnungspolitik.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,18,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"In its generality, the statement is hard to disagree with..."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,19,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Agree,Agree,Long term profitability will not be maximized when other stakeholders' interests are manifestly violated.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,20,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Disagree,Uncertain,"Not inequality per se undermines democracy, but the degree to which being rich or poor becomes hereditary."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,21,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Disagree,Agree,"Populism - as today's new nationalism - is driven by doubts about future living standard and way of life, rather than inequality at home."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,22,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Agree,Uncertain,Fighting populism-nationalism needs bold decisions promoting a sense of relevance and pride for European politics. That is no spending issue
Jan Pieter Krahnen,23,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Uncertain,Agree,The ECB can influence output via interest rates if and only if the investment function is monotonic everywhere. But this may not be true.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,24,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Disagree,Uncertain,"There are two caveats in the statement: first, output is below potential, and second, Ricardian equivalence does not hold."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,25,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,8,Agree,Agree,"I disagree because of unconditional nature of the statement. What if Ricardian equivalence holds, and investment function bends backwards?"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,26,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,8,Disagree,Agree,"Yes, a negative influence is possible because national elctorates may believe ""their"" agent will bias his/her decisions."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,27,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,"The phrase overstates the effective influence of trade-offs. An appointment balance may help to achieve mutual recognition, given quality."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,28,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"The response to geopolitical interests is a wise strong set of conditionalities if awarded, rather than exclusion from the bidding process."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,29,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,8,Agree,Agree,"In the Eurozone, banks' home bias creates bankruptcy risk because states cannot print the money needed to redeem their debt."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,30,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,8,Uncertain,Uncertain,"I only weakly agree, because there are second order effects of risk weights, and there are better alternatives, like concentration limits."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,31,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,5,Agree,Disagree,Second order (political) effects of changing risk weights are only poorly understood.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,32,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Too homogeneous a neighborhood in inner cities, as wel as in ""les banlieues"", may undermine cohesion and solidarity in society at large."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,33,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"“Fully implemented” implies implementation in a way that minimizes moral hazard, e.g. through a European reinsurance scheme."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,34,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"No, it would not iprovided it is implemented cleverly, e.g. relying on a reinsurance scheme."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,35,Goethe University Frankfurt,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Clearly, the statement is subject to decreasing marginal returns, so the optimal amount of spending is finite."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,36,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Uncertain,Disagree,"Given the high level of public spending on the arts in Europe, we may have reached the point of negative marginal returns in some countries."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,37,Goethe University Frankfurt,1,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"There are pros and cons, and I do not see easily how to weigh these arguments..."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,38,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,
Jan Pieter Krahnen,39,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,The point is that Board-level brain-time needed to justify volatile results is reduced to an -arguably- more reasonable time span.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,40,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,Board-level brain time is redirected to longer horizons - which on balance may benefit shareholders.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,41,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,5,Agree,Agree,"It is an unlikely combination, doing good and having private benefits too."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,42,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,6,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,There is an emotional benefit in pursuing such an investment stratategy that may be relevant here.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,43,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Agree,Agree,"The rule itself should be rock-solid, the user should herself select the buffers required to achieve the desired degree of flexibility."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,44,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,It increasese default probability through its indirect effect on future debt incentives
Jan Pieter Krahnen,45,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain, while the direct effect may be negligible.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,46,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,8,Disagree,Agree,"As in the case of Italy, rule-breaking carries the risk of repetition, although to a lessor extent for France."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,47,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Too many side and cross effects to consider in order to arrive at a ""safe"" welfare conclusion."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,48,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"The marginal cost of adding or subtracting vehicles instantly, according to traffic status, is lower with ride-sharers than with cabs."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,49,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Disagree,Agree,"As employment rate among migrants goes up over time, and much of taxation is indirect anyway, chances are that the statement comes true."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,50,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,
Jan Pieter Krahnen,51,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Often, in public debate, external forces and uncontrolled markets are blamed for poor economic performance, not true own political omissions"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,52,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Autonomous cars are relevant for urban areas, whereas smartphones have affected the life of almost everybody, thus a larger welfare effect."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,53,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Quite an absurd suggestion, vastly overestimating what monetary policy can achieve - in the end frustrating central bankers and the public."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,54,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,6,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,"A ""fair"" digital tax should allocate the tax base (profits) virtually among producer and consumer countries"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,55,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree, a 3% tax may start negotiations
Jan Pieter Krahnen,56,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Yes, but profit taxation requires negotiations between countries to share the tax base (unlikely to work in todays protectionist world)"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,57,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"A generalized answer to this question needs to be specify a particular industry. In banking I do not agree, in others I don't know enough."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,58,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Trade with China, as with other countries, is of a reciprocal nature, and it helps Europeans (and Chinese) in consumption and employment."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,59,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,This statement is in a way a no-brainer. But it begs the question whether it does not also help affected European producers to find a niche.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,60,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Agree,Agree,I do not believe in strategic trade policy as an instrument of welfare improvement: European and Chinese welfare are not substitutes.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,61,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Greece is now back on track, has accepted many hardships in order to comply with European requests - why should it change its stance?"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,62,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Exiting a currency union is tough. Lots of international exposures will be in default, because of the extreme devaluation."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,63,Goethe University Frankfurt,NA,6,No Opinion,Uncertain,The default-in-2010 option would have been close to Banking Union rules: Bail-in creditors - which at the time were mostly foreign banks
Jan Pieter Krahnen,64,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Agree,Agree,"A bitcoin is a private bet on becoming a (public) legal tender, and on earning the seignorage."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,65,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Again, tulips had developed into a mutually accepted expression of value, and bulbs were seen as the key (algorithm) to replication/mining."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,66,Goethe University Frankfurt,1,6,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,
Jan Pieter Krahnen,67,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"I know a few excellent students who in earlier years would have applied for a top US school, and who now prefer to stay in Europe."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,68,Goethe University Frankfurt,2,5,Agree,Uncertain,The effect of lower tax rate on average income is probably stronger than that of lower taxable income (given concurrent US-tax reduction).
Jan Pieter Krahnen,69,Goethe University Frankfurt,3,6,Agree,Disagree,Same as before.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,70,Goethe University Frankfurt,4,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Even if more women on boards meant better decisions, the effect on shareholder value in general equilibrium is likely non-positive."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,71,Goethe University Frankfurt,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"The sum of two marginal effects - one positive (women), the other negative (men) - is likely to be positive in this case."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,72,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,8,Uncertain,Agree,
Jan Pieter Krahnen,73,Goethe University Frankfurt,9,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,
Jan Pieter Krahnen,74,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,6,Disagree,Uncertain,
Jan Pieter Krahnen,75,Goethe University Frankfurt,8,6,Agree,Agree,"while I see the impact of nudging on macro outcomes (e.g. pension fund participation), I am uncertain whether this is due to irrationality."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,76,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"Direct effects likely negative, while indirect effects -ranging from fiscal stimuli to change in immigration policy- likely positive. Sum=?"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,77,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Agree,Agree,"We will see lots of changes, not only robots coming in. But also very different ways of working, leading also to shorter employment spells."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,78,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Absolutely. But mind the term ""could"". Whether or not it happens depends critically on fundamental adjustments of our societal architecture."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,79,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Exempting ride sharing services from existing regulations would put taxi firms at an imposed disadvantage, undermining efficiency."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,80,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Agree,Agree,
Jan Pieter Krahnen,81,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Welfare is affected by two effects, reduced competition (a minus), and increased safety/reliability (a plus). The sum is thus indeterminate."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,82,Goethe University Frankfurt,6,6,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,"The second policy option in the list (decentralized labor negotiations) may backfire, boosting strike incentives and lowering productivity."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,83,Goethe University Frankfurt,8,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,I only note in passing that the relationship between equilibrium unemployment rate and welfare is likely to be non-monotonic.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,84,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Agree,Agree,"APP has desired real effects iff credit supply is the problem, not demand, nor structural reform. Moreover, is mild deflation a threat?"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,85,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,APP may have opposite effect: Expectations of unsustainable debt levels at states and banks leading to low interest rates & low growth.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,86,Goethe University Frankfurt,8,7,Disagree,Agree,"A quant hedge fund may extract extra return by big data strategies, but an average guy, like myself, will likely fail with stock-picking."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,87,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Uncertain,Agree,"The emphasis is on ""without change in policy"" - but it is those changes that will weigh heavily on the policy agenda, e.g. retirement age."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,88,Goethe University Frankfurt,10,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Increasing retirement age will go hand in hand with changing work conditions. As a consequence, productivity of elderly is likely to rise."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,89,Goethe University Frankfurt,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"For hub-and-spoke structure, we need to balance agglomeration synergy against systemic risk externality (created at hub, borne by spokes).

Jan Pieter Krahnen,90,Goethe University Frankfurt,8,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"For non-tariff employees, income tax law and conducive (friendly) regulatory policies are way more important than hiring and firing rules."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,91,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Inject all capital into strong banks, not weak ones, thus restructuring and scaling down the entire sector. Good plan, but will not happen."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,92,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Europe's new regulatory architecture aims for market discipline through bail-inability of equity and junior debt. US pursues different model
-see background information here"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,93,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"While productivity has increased almost surely, production may actually have dropped significantly, as industry was largely dismantled."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,94,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Welfare comparisons are hard to substantiate. Moreover, note the identification problem: EU trade and migration happened simultaneously."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,95,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,8,Uncertain,Strongly Agree,"Freer migration has increased GDP, and thus has raised transfers to lower-skilled people. The balance, I believe (!), may well be positive."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,96,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Citizens, not workers or consumers are evaluated. Gains from trade have probably increased in terms of averaging across Europeans."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,97,Goethe University Frankfurt,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Gains from trade have increased the extent to which redistribution via the social security system can be effective.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,98,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,8,Disagree,Agree,"Note that crowdedness is endogenous, and an allocation of proceeds to all citizens (rather than other transportation users) is third best."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,99,Goethe University Frankfurt,5,7,Agree,Agree,"While benefits are consummated locally, negative externalities and allocative distortions are largely outside the country."
Jean-Pierre Danthine,1,Paris School of Economics,8,7,Agree,Agree,provided the public investments are real productivity boosters!
Jean-Pierre Danthine,2,Paris School of Economics,8,7,Agree,Agree,under same condition!
Jean-Pierre Danthine,3,Paris School of Economics,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"At the zero-lower-bound fiscal-monetary coordination is essential to avoid sub-optimal monetary policies.

Jean-Pierre Danthine,4,Paris School of Economics,3,5,Disagree,Disagree,A well crafted and timed transition strategy will create significant economic opportunities.
Jean-Pierre Danthine,5,Paris School of Economics,3,6,Agree,Agree,I tend to agree but reaching the goal while taking political constraints into account requires being pragmatic
Jean-Pierre Danthine,6,Paris School of Economics,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,Yes in the absence of compensating financial mechanisms that should be put in place to avoid that outcome.

Jean-Pierre Danthine,17,Paris School of Economics,9,6,Agree,Uncertain,Provided a long run perspective is adopted
Jean-Pierre Danthine,18,Paris School of Economics,7,6,Uncertain,Disagree,Regulation and legal mechanisms must be complemented by changes in investors’ convictions!
Jean-Pierre Danthine,19,Paris School of Economics,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"True where there is a rise in inequality. Inequalities are not the only, neither always the main source of pressure on liberal democracies."
Jean-Pierre Danthine,20,Paris School of Economics,7,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Unemployment, immigration and the design of the European project are as important causes of populism in Europe. Redistribution is not all."
Jean-Pierre Danthine,21,Paris School of Economics,7,7,Agree,Agree,Agree (even though vague statement and fighting populism is not only a money issue) because populism is a very important threat.

Jordi Galí,93,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,8,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"Access to a larger variety of goods and services, at lower prices. A higher standard of living overall."
Jordi Galí,94,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,4,7,Agree,Disagree,"Possibly, and at least in the short run, due to the reallocation of manufacturing activities in low wage new EU members."
Jordi Galí,95,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,8,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,Efficient allocation of a scarce resource to those who value it more.
Jordi Galí,96,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,At least in expectation the benefits should be positive if the deal is offered by a central authority.
Jordi Galí,97,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,7,7,Uncertain,Disagree,"Possibly not if competition is restricted to tax incentives, but more generally it may encourage more business-friendly policies for all."
Jordi Galí,98,Universitat Pompeu Fabra,9,8,Uncertain,Agree,"It all hinges on the post-Brexit arrangement between the UK and the EU. I wouldn't know how to predict that outcome, it's entirely political"

Karl Whelan,7,University College Dublin,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,There is still considerable uncertainty for firms (particularly in services) about the nature of the UK's future trading relationship.
Karl Whelan,8,University College Dublin,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Expect to hear ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" again. I suspect a bare-bones trade deal (zero tarrifs & quotas, no services) can be done"
Karl Whelan,9,University College Dublin,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,This (rather than failure to sort out the other issues in the WA) is the biggest chance that Brexit has a large sudden negative shock.
Karl Whelan,10,University College Dublin,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,"It's not clear climate change will be a major issue for central banks over this period, particularly given the narrow remit that many have."
Karl Whelan,11,University College Dublin,3,6,Disagree,Uncertain,I could be wrong here. There could be tipping point events where climate emergencies become a major financial issue.
Karl Whelan,12,University College Dublin,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,Not an easy question. Private R&D more likely to spent in zero-sum competitions for market share and establishing dominant market positions.
Karl Whelan,13,University College Dublin,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Similarly, much of the benefit of private medical R&D goes to profits made by drug producers."

Karl Whelan,16,University College Dublin,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,This could be the case (e.g. if profit maximizing involved polluting the environment) but these cases are best dealt with via regulation.
Karl Whelan,17,University College Dublin,4,6,Disagree,Uncertain,I'm not sure there is sufficient empirical evidence to back up this statement.
Karl Whelan,18,University College Dublin,8,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Why would this be easy? It's a really complex issue.
Karl Whelan,19,University College Dublin,3,7,Agree,Agree,More a political science question than an economics one. Stagnant median earnings perhaps a greater issue than inequality per se.
Karl Whelan,20,University College Dublin,8,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,Europe already does plenty of redistribution. And some populist parties (Brexit\Lega) actually have anti-redistribution policy platforms.
Karl Whelan,21,University College Dublin,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Unclear to me which areas of spending would do this. Better to evaluate spending proposals on their objective merits.
Karl Whelan,22,University College Dublin,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,With an unemployment rate of 7.5% there is still spare capacity in the EA. ECB can also boost investment which increases supply capacity.
Karl Whelan,23,University College Dublin,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,There is plenty of empirical evidence for this proposition.
Karl Whelan,24,University College Dublin,8,7,Agree,Uncertain,"Generally true though not, for example, in highly-indebted members of the Euro Area which do not have control of their own currency."
Karl Whelan,25,University College Dublin,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,ECB President is a key job and much has depended in recent years on Draghi's decisions. You need the right person for the job.

Karl Whelan,36,University College Dublin,10,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,“European champions” seems to be verbal linguistics to justify undermining competition policy.
Karl Whelan,37,University College Dublin,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,There may be some areas with huge economies of scale where this is true (eg aircraft production) but it will not generally be the case.
Karl Whelan,38,University College Dublin,6,5,Disagree,Uncertain,I can't see any good arguments for this change in reporting frequency having any positive effect on managerial decision making.
Karl Whelan,39,University College Dublin,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Shareholders are better off having access to regular information on the companies they own.
Karl Whelan,40,University College Dublin,3,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Companies most likely see CSP initiatives as part of a broader marketing budget. It may suit some to do more than others.
Karl Whelan,41,University College Dublin,5,5,Agree,Agree,Hard to sum this up with such a short question. All countries have an interest in co-operative behavior that reduces risks of climate change
Karl Whelan,42,University College Dublin,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,The rules should focus on maintaining overall debt sustainability and not on randomly chosen figures (such as deficit limits of 3 percent).
Karl Whelan,43,University College Dublin,6,7,Agree,Agree,Insolvency risk is driven by loss of market confidence and failure to roll over existing debt. This government is close to provoking this.
Karl Whelan,44,University College Dublin,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"France has lower debt\GDP and there is far less likelihood of a bond market ""strike"" on buying French debt. 3 percent is an arbitrary limit."
Karl Whelan,45,University College Dublin,8,7,Agree,Uncertain,Arbitrary caps on numbers employed in specific industries are unlikely to ever deliver good outcomes.

Karl Whelan,52,University College Dublin,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Generally best to tax profits or value added and not revenue. Hard to know why 3% would be the right figure.

Karl Whelan,58,University College Dublin,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain. The debt is unsustainable (see the recent CEPR report) but there will likely be debt relief thus avoiding an outright default.
Karl Whelan,59,University College Dublin,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Better to have larger sovereign default in 2011 restoring sustainability and avoiding the excessively tight fiscal policy of 2012 onwards.
Karl Whelan,60,University College Dublin,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Euro membership provided stability and low interest rates. The damage was done by ""debt denial "" and excessively tight fiscal policy."
Karl Whelan,61,University College Dublin,10,7,Agree,Disagree,On the relative similarity I agree but gold has actual uses (e.g. jewellery) which gives it some value. Bitcoin will likely end up worthless
Karl Whelan,62,University College Dublin,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,The tulips thing was a long time ago and there are various disagreements about it. But yes Bitcoin is more pure speculation than even gold.
Karl Whelan,63,University College Dublin,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,The US spends more on healthcare than European countries but covers a small fraction of the population and has inferior health outcomes.

Karl Whelan,77,University College Dublin,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Imposing restrictions on a particular sub-set of the market is unfair and hurts consumers.
Karl Whelan,78,University College Dublin,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Restrictive regulations relating to pricing or quantity supplied are rarely a good idea unless there is a clear market failure.
Karl Whelan,79,University College Dublin,4,7,Agree,Agree,Probably not a big effect. Would also bring some relatively lower productivity workers into employment This would lower average productivity
Karl Whelan,80,University College Dublin,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,It is likely that high levels of employment protection raise the natural rate of unemployment. But this is just one of many factors.
Karl Whelan,81,University College Dublin,6,7,Agree,Agree,QE is complex but most careful research shows it impacts long-term rates. ECB program has definitely reduced sovereign borrowing rates.
Karl Whelan,82,University College Dublin,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"The disagreement is because of the word ""substantial"". Not sure that any realistic policy can ""substantially"" improve European growth rates."

Karl Whelan,86,University College Dublin,5,7,Disagree,Agree,There may be some wider advantages for Europe due to the clustering of financial service activity in London but it is likely to be small.
Karl Whelan,87,University College Dublin,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Agree,"I don't believe labour laws in France, Germany or Ireland, for example, will be a deterring factor for financial service firms."
Karl Whelan,88,University College Dublin,3,7,Agree,Agree,This may improve financial stability in the short-run but probably sets a bad fiscal precedent for other European governments in the future.
Karl Whelan,89,University College Dublin,5,8,Agree,Agree,This would undermine the EU's BRRD approach though it always seemed likely loss imposition was more a policy intended for small countries.
Karl Whelan,90,University College Dublin,4,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,Agree but moving from state-sponsored monopolies to badly-regulated private sector monopolies does not do much for the average consumer.
Karl Whelan,91,University College Dublin,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Agree, though effects on the average person are not the same as on every person."
Karl Whelan,92,University College Dublin,1,6,Disagree,Disagree,Empirical evidence on effects of migration from Eastern Europe suggest limited effects on wages in the UK for example.
Karl Whelan,93,University College Dublin,5,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,I agree but evidence on productivity suggests that the gains from this kind of liberalisation have been smaller than anticipated.
Karl Whelan,94,University College Dublin,9,7,Disagree,Disagree,Eastern European immigration has had limited effects on wages in Western Europe. Trade liberalisation with non-EU areas more important.
Karl Whelan,95,University College Dublin,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"If we are going to tax things (and we have to) it's best to tax things that have negative effects such as congestion, alcohol, carbon etc."
Karl Whelan,96,University College Dublin,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"This can be true but governments aren't always great at ""picking winners."" Some special local tax rates are probably just bad ideas."
Karl Whelan,97,University College Dublin,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,This kind of process drives down average corporate tax rates across the EU. There are probably better ways to cut taxes.
Karl Whelan,98,University College Dublin,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,Tarriffs & non-tarriff barriers with the EU $ the likely re-introduction of state aids and subsidies will have negative supply-side effects.
Karl Whelan,99,University College Dublin,5,7,Agree,Agree,The trade impact on the rest of the EU will be proportionately less than for the UK but this is still a negative.

Kevin O'Rourke,95,Oxford,5,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,The average citizen is a fiction so I would like to know more about distributional implications of the charges & whose taxes will be cut.
Kevin O'Rourke,96,Oxford,8,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"It depends on the nature of the incentives and the nature of firms. Targeting sectors presumably better than targeting ""specific firms""."
Kevin O'Rourke,97,Oxford,8,7,Uncertain,Disagree,Depends on nature of incentives & on whether there is competition between EU & rest of world. There may be negative distributional effects
Kevin O'Rourke,98,Oxford,8,8,Uncertain,Agree,We don't know yet what form Brexit will take. If the UK chooses to stay in the EEA & customs union the economic consequences will be minimal
Kevin O'Rourke,99,Oxford,8,7,Uncertain,Agree,Same comment as before. But in any event the consequences will be less for the EU 27 taken as a whole.

Nicholas Bloom,98,Stanford,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,Brexit will reduce trade and immigration because of higher barriers to both. Uncertainty will reduce investment and R&D in the short run
Nicholas Bloom,99,Stanford,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"The EU has been driving free markets, trade and openess across Europe. Brexit weakens the EU, and this weakens these pro-growth forces."

Olivier Blanchard,1,Peterson Institute,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Running a smaller primary surplus, so increasing demand and output would likely lead to a real appreciation and an increase in real income."
Olivier Blanchard,2,Peterson Institute,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"I believe that there is still a negative output gap in the euro zone, and m policy cannot help much."
Olivier Blanchard,3,Peterson Institute,9,8,Agree,Agree,"fiscal expansion yes. Coordinated: better, but not of the essence."
Olivier Blanchard,4,Peterson Institute,7,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Carbon taxes or caps are likely to lead to stranded assets, but alsohigh investment in new technologies. May come with higher tfp as well."
Olivier Blanchard,5,Peterson Institute,7,6,Uncertain,Agree,"Weitzman discussion of prices versus quantities. Cap and trade more manipulable, but achieving given quantity for sure may be needed."
Olivier Blanchard,6,Peterson Institute,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Afraid that this may be right. May justify helping them through other channels.

Olivier Blanchard,18,Peterson Institute,8,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"I believe in more representation of workers on the board, primarily for information and trust reasons."
Olivier Blanchard,19,Peterson Institute,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Based on my reading of the research, not the only reason, but, in most countries, the main one."

Olivier Blanchard,21,Peterson Institute,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"This fits with my view that, in many countries, a more accommodating fiscal policy is needed on other grounds at this juncture"

Olivier Blanchard,51,Peterson Institute,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"why not ask for 10% productivity growth? (one footnote: hysteresis, if present, implies a slightly more aggressive monetary policy)"

Olivier Blanchard,61,Peterson Institute,9,7,Strongly Agree,Disagree,
Olivier Blanchard,62,Peterson Institute,9,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Like bitcoin, the two assets have some intrinsic value. Much of their price however reflects a bubble. A draw"

Olivier Blanchard,64,Peterson Institute,4,7,Agree,Agree,
Olivier Blanchard,65,Peterson Institute,7,6,Agree,Disagree,"sure of the answer if ``at a common rate''. Not sure about the 20%, if different from current mean"
Olivier Blanchard,66,Peterson Institute,7,6,Agree,Strongly Disagree,"if by average, we mean ``mean''. Distribution effects between capital and labor income might have adverse implications."

Olivier Blanchard,80,Peterson Institute,9,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Such a reform changes the nature of unemployment (shorter duration, higher flows) for the better. Net effect on the rate is ambiguous."
Olivier Blanchard,81,Peterson Institute,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Hard to see how monetary expansion, in whatever form, would do nothing for activity or inflation. Cannot think of strong perverse effects"
Olivier Blanchard,82,Peterson Institute,9,6,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,one may disagree with ``strongly''. but it would work in the right direction.

Olivier Blanchard,98,Peterson Institute,8,8,Agree,Agree,I do not see the benefits which compensate the loss of full access to the EU market.
Olivier Blanchard,99,Peterson Institute,6,7,Agree,Agree,"Again, loss of full access to UK market is a minus, although small. Political implications re EU construction can go one way or the other"

Patrick Honohan,8,Trinity College Dublin,7,7,Disagree,Agree,"Reduction in risk of no-deal exit helps, but reduced chance of remain does not."
Patrick Honohan,9,Trinity College Dublin,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Probability of no deal is still not zero, but is greatly reduced."
Patrick Honohan,10,Trinity College Dublin,10,6,Disagree,Uncertain,This is why no deal is now unlikely

Per Krusell,8,Stockholm University,8,8,Agree,Agree,
Per Krusell,9,Stockholm University,8,5,Disagree,Disagree,"I take it that the comparison includes all components (quality, on-time delivery, etc). Helping inefficient companies doesn’t improve them."

Per Krusell,15,Stockholm University,2,8,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,Moral hazard is relevant but so is a risk of runs. I’m not an expert.
Per Krusell,16,Stockholm University,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,I'm no expert on this but I think there are good reasons for some amount of support of the arts.
Per Krusell,17,Stockholm University,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,"I'm not aware of the current level of support. As I said, some public support is called for."
Per Krusell,18,Stockholm University,2,7,Uncertain,Disagree,It depends on the particular sector and the particular foreign competition. I can see it going both ways.
Per Krusell,19,Stockholm University,2,6,Uncertain,Disagree,
Per Krusell,20,Stockholm University,4,5,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,My view is not based on research but on beliefs formed by talking to businesses.
Per Krusell,21,Stockholm University,4,5,Disagree,Uncertain,I just don’t think it would matter much.
Per Krusell,22,Stockholm University,3,5,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"I haven’t seen any evidence to support this claim and tested theory predicts the opposite. But if it’s a fad it can pay off, like any fad."
Per Krusell,23,Stockholm University,8,5,Disagree,Agree,"I define welfare in traditional ways (goods and services, leisure). If Norwegians attach a moral value to these actions, maybe it is a plus."

Per Krusell,30,Stockholm University,8,7,Agree,Agree,In welfare states with poor integration the net monetary gain is likely negative. This does not mean one should not allow asylum seekers.

Per Krusell,49,Stockholm University,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,It depends on how the resulting debt will be financed.
Per Krusell,50,Stockholm University,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,Initially the reaction may be the opposite but my belief is that over the longer run it would be a plus. No data to back it up though!
Per Krusell,51,Stockholm University,9,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,It's about making use of the talents of the entire population: good for prosperity. Much of management is (male) networking.
Per Krusell,52,Stockholm University,8,5,Disagree,Disagree,A tax is a more direct instrument for reducing emissions - the main goal - and R&D subsidies are at best an imperfect substitute.
Per Krusell,53,Stockholm University,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,My understanding is that they have been very costly and not paid back for Germany.
Per Krusell,54,Stockholm University,8,8,Agree,Agree,"The R&D has had benefits and the point is that they are global, not German-specific. I have not seen any cost-benefit analysis though."
Per Krusell,55,Stockholm University,5,6,Disagree,Uncertain,
Per Krusell,56,Stockholm University,8,6,Disagree,Uncertain,The adjustment likely takes longer (even though German labor markets allow low entry wages). Eventually the average benefits will be > 0.
Per Krusell,57,Stockholm University,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Perhaps unemployment could rise in the short run but employment will respond to labor supply: there will be jobs.
Per Krusell,58,Stockholm University,9,6,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,If it is profitable to employ robots it is very likely more efficient. So almost by definition they increase production efficiency.

Per Krusell,68,Stockholm University,2,7,Disagree,Agree, behavioral responses exist but are limited.
Per Krusell,69,Stockholm University,2,7,Disagree,Agree,"To the extent there is cont'd general productivity growth and we get richer, people may want more leisure, but this effect is likely small."
Per Krusell,70,Stockholm University,3,7,Uncertain,Agree,It's not clear to me what the positive agglomeration activities are. Agglomeration can be bad too. But I'm far from an expert on this!
Per Krusell,71,Stockholm University,7,8,Agree,Agree,Not obvious that labor regulation is that relevant in this particular sector. It is in others but finance is full of other incentives.
Per Krusell,72,Stockholm University,NA,8,No Opinion,Strongly Agree,I don't have enough info to say that it would help financial institutions elsewhere
Per Krusell,73,Stockholm University,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree, depends on cross-holdings. In long run it's likely bad.
Per Krusell,74,Stockholm University,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,The expectations of future bailouts will likely be affected and induce excessive risk-taking.
Per Krusell,75,Stockholm University,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,I have no knowledge in this area.
Per Krusell,76,Stockholm University,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,People migrate because they want to. Secondary effects are likely positive too.
Per Krusell,77,Stockholm University,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"Same as trade question. Some gain, some lose, also among low-skilled workers."
Per Krusell,78,Stockholm University,7,6,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,"I am not a trade economist by specialization, which explains why I selected somewhat limited confidence."
Per Krusell,79,Stockholm University,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,I think mist low-wage competition is from outside of Europe. Of course some always lose from trade. But many low-skilled workers gain too.
Per Krusell,80,Stockholm University,8,8,Agree,Agree,this approach works in theory and seems to also work in practice
Per Krusell,81,Stockholm University,7,7,Agree,Agree,this is good policy only if the government is able to select the right companies - which it is typically not

Peter Neary,20,Oxford,6,7,Agree,Uncertain,"Modern corporations should be regulated, including anti-trust, regulation to ensure compliance with environmental and labor standards, etc."
Peter Neary,21,Oxford,6,7,Agree,Agree,Regulation is a multi-faceted goal
Peter Neary,22,Oxford,4,7,Disagree,Uncertain, legistating on the composion of boards of directors may not be a good instrument to achieve it
Peter Neary,23,Oxford,5,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Rising inequality is a contributing factor
Peter Neary,24,Oxford,4,7,Agree,Uncertain, but real or imagined threats from immigration are more salient in Europe. Populists exploit both
Peter Neary,25,Oxford,7,8,Agree,Agree,Announcement effects of such policies could have short-term benefits
Peter Neary,26,Oxford,6,8,Uncertain,Agree, but the direct effects will only be long-term
Peter Neary,27,Oxford,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Retreating from austerity in UK, or boosting Eurozone aggregate demand, plus efforts to reduce inequality should help, if sold positively"
Peter Neary,28,Oxford,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,"ECB can’t do much given low interest rates, but I can stop things getting worse"
Peter Neary,29,Oxford,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,Only models with implausible degrees of wage/price flexibility predict otherwise.
Peter Neary,30,Oxford,NA,8,8,Uncertain,"Agree, but this is more a political/moral judgement than a scientifically grounded view. And depends on circumstances, esp. size of deficit"
Peter Neary,31,Oxford,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Disagree,"""Competence"" should be interpreted broadly: commanding academic respect but also with personal, political and administrative skills"
Peter Neary,32,Oxford,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,The track record to date is not bad. Hopefully this will continue. It would clearly be worrying if the post became totally politicized.
Peter Neary,33,Oxford,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Strongly Disagree,It depends. The trade-off is between security and buying from the best supplier. Excluding all foreign bidders is just protectionism.

Peter Neary,43,Oxford,6,7,Agree,Agree,"If the choice is between a world Chinese monopoly or a world duopoly with a European firm, then subsidies are justified. But details matter"
Peter Neary,44,Oxford,6,6,Agree,Disagree,Not my specialty. I would expect source of funding rather than frequency of reporting to be more important in promoting long-term thinking
Peter Neary,45,Oxford,8,7,Agree,Uncertain,"Same answer as to (A), with the added proviso that long-term thinking may be good for society but not necessarily for all shareholders"
Peter Neary,46,Oxford,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,An old debate. John Stuart Mill nailed it: private sector to maximize efficiency
Peter Neary,47,Oxford,7,6,Strongly Agree,Uncertain," public to look after distribution, social goals etc."
Peter Neary,48,Oxford,8,7,Agree,Agree,Weakly agree
Peter Neary,49,Oxford,6,7,Strongly Agree,Agree, tho main benefit of the Norwegian fund is as the poster-boy of how to manage windfalls to mitigate the natural resource curse
Peter Neary,50,Oxford,3,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Maastricht rules are very restrictive. Some kind of closer fiscal union needed to control moral hazard, but stabilisation more important"
Peter Neary,51,Oxford,6,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,The right decision given current rules - which should be changed.
Peter Neary,52,Oxford,2,5,Agree,Uncertain,What’s good for Italy ...
Peter Neary,53,Oxford,2,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Restricting quantity will raise prices and lower average welfare. Effects on congestion unlikely to be significant
Peter Neary,54,Oxford,3,6,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,Singapore pioneered road pricing decades ago. Sad that it has not been more widely copied. Scarce resources given away freely makes no sense
Peter Neary,55,Oxford,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Simple demographics: all the studies I know show that, on average, immigrants are younger, healthier and have fewer dependents than natives"
Peter Neary,56,Oxford,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Ideas can be protected, and imitation is costly, but the statement is broadly correct, with huge implications for R&D and antitrust policy

Peter Neary,57,Oxford,6,7,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Emergency intervention can have immediate effects. But policy mostly has slow effects, especially on aggregate productivity"
Peter Neary,58,Oxford,2,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Autonomous cars could contribute to lower emissions and greatly reduced congestion
Peter Neary,59,Oxford,2,7,Uncertain,Disagree, but only with consistent urban planning
Peter Neary,60,Oxford,2,7,Agree,Agree,This target is hard to influence with any instrument
Peter Neary,61,Oxford,4,7,Disagree,Disagree, monetary policy is not the right one
Peter Neary,62,Oxford,1,6,Uncertain,Disagree,
Peter Neary,63,Oxford,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,
Peter Neary,64,Oxford,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Given the size of the European market, favouring EU-based firms need not be so costly, provided a robust approach is taken to market abuse."
Peter Neary,65,Oxford,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Disagree,"Gains from trade on average is one of the most widely accepted predictions of economic theory, stemming from specialisation and wider choice

Peter Neary,72,Oxford,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,If I knew the answer I would take a position on them!
Peter Neary,73,Oxford,7,6,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,More fragmented demand side (mainly private rather than public suppliers) a factor
Peter Neary,74,Oxford,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain, also looser regulation on marketing (not R&D)
Peter Neary,75,Oxford,7,6,Agree,Agree,Hostility to immigrants deters newcomers. Mainland European and Asian countries are seeking to benefit from this.

Peter Neary,77,Oxford,4,7,Agree,Agree,
Peter Neary,78,Oxford,4,7,Agree,Agree,I am in favour of this kind of measure in principle but do not want to claim that it would affect shareholder value for the better
Peter Neary,79,Oxford,4,7,Agree,Agree, no worse
Peter Neary,80,Oxford,4,7,Agree,Agree,Benefits yes
Peter Neary,81,Oxford,5,7,Agree,Agree," more openings for women, encouraging human capital acquisition, better decisions. I am not sure they would be ""substantial"""
Peter Neary,82,Oxford,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Given revenue neutrality, choosing between the policies hinges on uncertainty (which renewables?) & on macro considerations: stimulus better"
Peter Neary,83,Oxford,8,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,These policies are a global public good: clear net benefits for the world (emissions fall) but not necessarily for Germany
Peter Neary,84,Oxford,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Definitely positive, though clearly not necessarily very large relative to the scale of global emissions"
Peter Neary,85,Oxford,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,
Peter Neary,86,Oxford,8,7,Agree,Agree,Net benefits from increased labor supply. Losses to some workers possible. Poor integration could lead to social unrest: safety nets needed
Peter Neary,87,Oxford,6,7,Agree,Agree,"Some workers will be displaced, some will retrain, the new technology is likely to diffuse slowly, especially in service industries."
Peter Neary,88,Oxford,3,7,Agree,Agree,"I agree in principle, though compensation rarely occurs in practice and would require Nordic levels of income support and retraining."
Peter Neary,89,Oxford,3,8,Disagree,Agree,"Taxis are excessively regulated in many cities, so increased competition is desirable. But regulation also has a role in protecting consumer"
Peter Neary,90,Oxford,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"More competition is desirable. In this scenario Uber's only advantage is its superior technology and organisation, likely to be short-lived."
Peter Neary,91,Oxford,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,
Peter Neary,92,Oxford,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"""All else equal"" agreed. But it risks triggering further disillusionment with globalization. Accompanying macro stimulus would ease the pain"
Peter Neary,93,Oxford,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"All else equal again. And the details matter. Something like Danish ""flexicurity"" would be good, naive deregulation bad."
Peter Neary,94,Oxford,6,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Reduced but not eliminated. Monetary policy alone cannot get the EU out of deflation, only a rise in external demand or a fiscal stimulus."
Peter Neary,95,Oxford,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"""Substantial"" Is a big ask, and growth will ultimately be affected more by structural issues and demand-side shocks"
Peter Neary,96,Oxford,8,6,Disagree,Uncertain,A small industry exists to help naive investors beat the market. It should be subject to mandatory health warnings.
Peter Neary,97,Oxford,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,Automation could conceivably offset fall in labor input to population ratio but unlikely
Peter Neary,98,Oxford,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Especially if not compulsory, such changes could even be welcomed by increasingly healthy 65-year olds"
Peter Neary,99,Oxford,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Local costs (high house prices, inequality) but clear EU-wide gains to agglomeration. Unsustainable outside the Single Market however."

Pol Antras,4,Harvard,4,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"It's certainly would be costly, but I don't know what is meant by ""major drag on economic growth"""
Pol Antras,5,Harvard,8,6,Agree,Agree,The late Marty Weitzman taught us that the theoretical answer is ambiguous
Pol Antras,6,Harvard,5,5,Agree,Uncertain, but taxes are more transparent and less prone to rent-seeking
Pol Antras,7,Harvard,6,7,Uncertain,Disagree,It is hard to imagine that the incidence of the border tax would be such that only importing countries bear the cost
Pol Antras,8,Harvard,6,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Decline in uncertainty will be good for the economy, but there may be other transitional costs"
Pol Antras,9,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,"This question is about politics, not economics. Judging from what Johnson said today (12/17), there will be a deal. But what do I know?!"
Pol Antras,10,Harvard,8,6,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,Almost certainly would generate uncertainty and increase other transitional costs
Pol Antras,11,Harvard,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"Seems like a rather inadequate policy tool, even if other coordination mechanisms may not be working. Wrong time horizon too."
Pol Antras,12,Harvard,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,That's not my reading of the evidence. The threat seems too far in the future to affect financial variable any time soon. But I'm no expert.
Pol Antras,13,Harvard,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,
Pol Antras,14,Harvard,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,
Pol Antras,15,Harvard,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"It is not the ONLY valuable tool, but in my view it is certainly a highly informative tool."

Pol Antras,25,Harvard,8,8,Agree,Agree,
Pol Antras,26,Harvard,1,8,Agree,Agree,Though some geographical diversity in the Board is certainly a desirable goal.
Pol Antras,27,Harvard,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,
Pol Antras,28,Harvard,NA,8,No Opinion,Agree,If foreigners want to sell us goods/services at subsidized prices it’s generally good to let them do it. I’m not sure any caveats apply here

Pol Antras,37,Harvard,8,6,Uncertain,Disagree,Answer certainly depends on the sector under study.
Pol Antras,38,Harvard,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Profit-shifting effects could rationalize this, but answer depends on what the foreign & European merger would do to costs and market power"

Pol Antras,41,Harvard,6,5,Agree,Agree,"Not my field, but it's not clear to me how these factors would affect the stochastic discount factor. It seems it's mostly a level effect."

Pol Antras,48,Harvard,2,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Though for some countries (such as Sweden) it is a bit less obvious than for others, especially if migrants do not integrate well."
Pol Antras,49,Harvard,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,The fact that ideas are nonrival points to aggregate increasing returns to scale in the production of goods (not in technical change)
Pol Antras,50,Harvard,9,5,Uncertain,Disagree,And governments react to this by over-implementing policies that generate noticeable short-term benefits and (possibly) long-run costs.
Pol Antras,51,Harvard,5,8,Agree,Agree,"This is a tough question for economists to answer given scant available evidence. And, regrettably, I have misplaced my crystal ball."
Pol Antras,52,Harvard,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,
Pol Antras,53,Harvard,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,But I'm not sure whether 3% is close to optimal tax
Pol Antras,54,Harvard,5,6,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,I don't fully understand. Is the idea that costs are harder to verify than revenue for this activity? Or is it motivated by profit shifting?

Pol Antras,65,Harvard,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Disagree,The role of immigrants in U.S. innovation has been and continues to be very important. A decline in immigration will harm U.S. innovation.

-see background information here"
Pol Antras,69,Harvard,1,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Again I am broadly supportive. But a 25% vs a 40% quota could generate very distinct effects. The 40% quota in Norway didn't seem to do much

Pol Antras,72,Harvard,8,8,Agree,Agree,
Pol Antras,73,Harvard,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Still, models with fully rational agents provide a perfectly good approximation for explaining many market outcomes!"
Pol Antras,74,Harvard,7,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,The effect on aggregate income (even aggregate income per capita) will likely be positive
Pol Antras,75,Harvard,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree, but distributive effects might lead to discontent
Pol Antras,76,Harvard,6,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Historical evidence doesn't make me too pessimistic but some adjustment to labor market policies might be necessary to avoid transition cost
Pol Antras,77,Harvard,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,It seems pretty clear that the potential gains would outweigh the losses.
Pol Antras,78,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,"It depends on what is meant by regulation. Ride-sharing platforms ought to be regulated, but some of current taxi regulations are harmful"
Pol Antras,79,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,A positive effect on consumer surplus seems clear
Pol Antras,80,Harvard,8,7,Agree,Agree," on the producer side, there are winners and losers"
Pol Antras,81,Harvard,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,"Leaving aside potential congestion and environmental concerns, the quick rise of (among others) Uber indicates that competition was limited"
Pol Antras,82,Harvard,NA,6,No Opinion,Uncertain,

Pol Antras,86,Harvard,7,7,Agree,Agree,Unless the investor is a risk lover
Pol Antras,87,Harvard,4,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Hard to argue against ""downward influence"". A different matter is whether GDP per capita will fall, which is possible but unlikely"
Pol Antras,88,Harvard,5,7,Agree,Agree,"It's not just higher life expectancy, but also better health at current health retirement ages"
Pol Antras,89,Harvard,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Agglomeration economies in this industry appear to be pervasive (New York City, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.)"
Pol Antras,90,Harvard,9,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,I'm no expert on labor market regulations. But I'd imagine that other factors were more important in making London Europe's financial center
Pol Antras,91,Harvard,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,It would probably improve financial stability. A different matter is whether that should be the only principle guiding tax policy.
Pol Antras,92,Harvard,6,6,Uncertain,Disagree,It seems pretty clear that bailouts generate a moral hazard problem. They also have a significant impact on government budgets.
Pol Antras,93,Harvard,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,
Pol Antras,94,Harvard,6,7,Uncertain,Disagree,"As with trade, it would be hard to argue that migration has been worse for the average western citizen."
Pol Antras,95,Harvard,9,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"As with trade, the effects on low-skilled workers are a bit less clear. Immigrants compete more directly with them. Some might have lost.

Pol Antras,96,Harvard,7,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,It would be hard to argue it has been worse for the average western citizen
Pol Antras,97,Harvard,9,7,Uncertain,Disagree,The sentiment of many low-skilled workers is that they might have been made worse off. This is probably true for some but not clear how many

Richard William Blundell,98,University College London,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,The tariff-free single market across Europe together with the integration of skilled labour market adds significantly to UK real income.
Richard William Blundell,99,University College London,7,7,Agree,Agree,The UK is a major influence in improving economic policy and a large trading partner. A decline in this will have a negative impact on EU.
