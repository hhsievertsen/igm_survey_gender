Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,1,Paris School of Economics,f,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Germany's current account surplus is undesirable even from a purely German viewpoint: the country would be better off if, for example, it ran a smaller primary surplus, in turn leading to a smaller current account surplus.",The demography justifies a smaller surplus. Returns from foreign investments are not great.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,2,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: The Eurozone would be in better shape if fiscal policy were more expansionary, which would allow monetary policy to be slightly less so.",Depends on which country expands.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,3,Paris School of Economics,f,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question C: If there is a recession in the Eurozone, it will be essential to have a coordinated fiscal expansion.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,4,Paris School of Economics,f,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question A: The European Union goal of reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 will be a major drag on economic growth.,Depends on how the policy is carried out. The overall drag on growth may be limited but large uncertainty. Counterfactual is also unclear.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,5,Paris School of Economics,f,5,6,Agree,Agree,Question B: Carbon taxes are a better way to implement climate policy than cap-and-trade.,In theory cap-and-trade is attractive but in practice it fails to give a long-term perspective on carbon prices.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,6,Paris School of Economics,f,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question C: A carbon border tax targeting imports from non-EU countries with less strict climate policies is likely to harm developing economies.,Developing countries will be major losers of climate change. They may in fact negotiate lump-sum transfers.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,7,Paris School of Economics,f,1,7,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: Following the UK election result, the certainty that the country is going to leave the European Union will provide a substantial short-term boost to the UK economy.",More certainty on higher transaction costs: net effect is unclear.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,8,Paris School of Economics,f,4,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question B: Given that the transition period currently expires at the end of 2020, there is still a considerable risk that the UK will leave the European Union without a trade agreement.",There will likely be an agreement; the problem is its content.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,9,Paris School of Economics,f,10,7,Agree,Agree,Question C: Leaving the European Union without a trade agreement would have a large negative impact on the UK economy.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,10,Paris School of Economics,f,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: Under current policies on climate change, the associated physical risks (such as those arising from total seasonal rainfall and sea level changes, and increased frequency, severity, and correlation of extreme weather events) will be at most a very small factor in monetary policy decisions over the next decade.",It is not clear whether these events will have a sizeable impact on inflation.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,11,Paris School of Economics,f,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: The physical risks associated with climate change under current policies are likely to threaten financial stability over the next decade.,Some asset classes may abruptly lose value.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,12,Paris School of Economics,f,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Europeans would benefit more from an extra €1 billion of public R&D spent through existing (public) channels than from an extra €1 billion of private R&D spent through existing (private) channels, all else equal.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,13,Paris School of Economics,f,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Europeans would benefit more from an extra €1 billion of public medical research spent through existing (public) channels than from an extra €1 billion of private medical research spent through existing (private) channels, all else equal.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,14,Paris School of Economics,f,1,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for answering some long unsettled questions in development economics research.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,15,Paris School of Economics,f,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for making significant progress in poverty reduction.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,16,Paris School of Economics,f,4,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Having companies run to maximize shareholder value creates significant negative externalities for workers and communities.,Depends on the horizon of the shareholders and on the regulation.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,17,Paris School of Economics,f,2,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: Appropriately managed corporations could create significantly greater value than they currently do for a range of stakeholders – including workers, suppliers, customers and community members – with small impacts on shareholder value.",Probably not at short horizon. More uncertain at longer horizons.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,18,Paris School of Economics,f,6,6,Agree,Disagree,"Question C:
Effective mechanisms for boards of directors to ensure that CEOs act in ways that balance the interests of all stakeholders would be straightforward to introduce.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,19,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: Rising inequality is straining the health of liberal democracy.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,20,Paris School of Economics,f,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: Enacting more redistributive expenditures and policies would be likely to limit the rise of populism in Europe.,No general answer. Depends on the country. Sometimes better schooling or better targeted transfers rather than more transfers is required.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,21,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question C: European governments should allocate more resources to policies that would be likely to limit the rise of populism in Europe, even if it means higher public debt or lower public spending in other areas.",Redistribution between living generations should not be financed by debt.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,22,Paris School of Economics,f,4,7,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: At this point, there is little that the European Central Bank can do to increase or maintain output in the Eurozone.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,23,Paris School of Economics,f,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: When the economy is operating below its potential, larger fiscal deficits are likely to increase demand and output.",The problem is to calculate the potential.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,24,Paris School of Economics,f,5,7,Agree,Uncertain,"Question C: When the economy is operating below its potential and monetary policy is at the effective lower bound, fiscal policy should prioritize increasing output over decreasing public debt.",To the extent that the government can borrow at fixed long term rate
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,25,Paris School of Economics,f,8,8,Agree,Agree,Question A: Selecting candidates for membership of the ECB Executive Board based primarily on nationality ahead of competence is likely to have a negative effect on the quality of monetary policy in the Eurozone.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,26,Paris School of Economics,f,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Although the central bank can never be an entirely technocratic institution, the selection process for the ECB President and members of the Executive Board is significantly worsened by intergovernmental trade-offs involving appointments to other European institutions.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,27,Paris School of Economics,f,3,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"On bids for infrastructure projects, the average European would be better off if Europe’s governments favored European firms over Chinese firms (or firms from any other country with non-profit-related geopolitical strategies) — even if it means sometimes choosing a higher-cost bidder.",Probably not in the short term. More uncertain in the longer term due to scale/lock-in effectssecurity issues. Depends on the sector.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,28,Paris School of Economics,f,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: Breaking the “doom loop” — a negative spiral that can result when banks hold sovereign bonds and governments bail out banks — would increase the stability of European economies in the event of another financial crisis.,Not least because it would ease the ability of the ECB to fully play its role of a lender of last resort.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,29,Paris School of Economics,f,10,8,Disagree,Agree,Question B: Regulators should try to break the doom loop by assigning positive risk weights — in calculating banks’ capital requirements — to banks’ holdings of domestic and other Eurozone sovereign bonds.,Concentration charges would be more adequate to avoid triggering a crisis in the short term.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,30,Paris School of Economics,f,5,8,Agree,Uncertain,Question C: Breaking the doom loop would impose substantial costs on powerful political constituencies.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,31,Paris School of Economics,f,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Residents of big European cities would be better off, on balance, if governments did more to counter gentrification, for example by using rent and other housing subsidies, public housing investments, zoning regulations, or similar policies.",Difficult in practice since housing subsidies may be captured while public housing may end up crowding out the middle class.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,32,Paris School of Economics,f,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: A common European deposit insurance scheme, once fully implemented, would increase the stability of European economies in the event of another financial crisis.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,33,Paris School of Economics,f,9,8,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: A common European deposit insurance scheme, once fully implemented, would increase the likelihood of another financial crisis in Europe.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,34,Paris School of Economics,f,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Overall, public spending on the arts in Europe creates benefits that exceed the deadweight loss caused by taxation to fund it.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,35,Paris School of Economics,f,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question B: Additional public spending on the arts in Europe would create incremental benefits that exceed the deadweight loss caused by taxation to fund it.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,36,Paris School of Economics,f,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: The average European is better off if Europe’s competition authorities let firms merge into European champions in their sectors, even it weakens competition.","Less competition in upstream industries may reduce competitiveness in other sectors, on top of directly reducing purchasing power."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,37,Paris School of Economics,f,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question B: If China and other countries use policies that create giant international firms, then the average European is better off if Europe's competition authorities let firms merge into European champions in their sectors, even it weakens competition.",The eu should rather uses wto tools more intensively.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,38,Paris School of Economics,f,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded European firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,39,Paris School of Economics,f,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: A switch from quarterly to annual earnings reports would, on net, benefit shareholders of European firms.",Depends on their time horizon.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,40,Paris School of Economics,f,1,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: To the extent that public corporations pursue social and environmental initiatives, they tend to achieve higher risk-adjusted (private) returns than otherwise similar corporations that pursue such initiatives less.",It probably depends on the investment horizon.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,41,Paris School of Economics,f,6,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: To the extent that Norway’s global government pension fund makes investments for social and environmental objectives — apart from investments that would bring the highest expected risk-adjusted returns — it improves the welfare of Norwegians.,The fund has a long horizon.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,42,Paris School of Economics,f,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: The fiscal rules of the European Union should give more flexibility to member countries.,More flexibility in the sense of more leeway for counter-cyclical policies; not in the sense of an ever rising debt nor even more complexity
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,43,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Disagree,Agree,Question B: The Italian budget for 2019 that the European Commission rejected in October would have increased Italy’s risk of fiscal insolvency substantially.,The problem is not the deficit of 2019 but its use and the lack of commitment for the future.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,44,Paris School of Economics,f,10,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Question C: If France runs a 2019 budget deficit of around 3.4% of GDP, as announced by President Macron’s government, France’s risk of fiscal insolvency will increase substantially.",Due to double counting the deficit is inflated by 0.9pp and France has no problem of market access. But commitment to adjust necessary.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,45,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Capping the number of ride-sharing drivers as is being discussed in New York City, Chicago and London will make the average resident in that city worse off.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,46,Paris School of Economics,f,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B:
To achieve a given level of congestion, it would be better to use taxes for driving that vary based on the level of congestion, rather than limiting the number of ride-sharing vehicles.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,47,Paris School of Economics,f,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,People who migrated to Europe between 2015 and 2018 are likely — over the next two decades — to contribute more in taxes paid than they receive in benefits and public services.,A bit less sure for refugees than for economic migrants
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,48,Paris School of Economics,f,1,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Ideas are nonrival, so increasing returns to scale is an essential feature of technological change in a market economy.",I am not sure this is just due to ideas being non-rival.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,49,Paris School of Economics,f,NA,7,No Opinion,Agree,Voters overestimate the effect that current governments have on their economies’ concurrent economic performance.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,50,Paris School of Economics,f,7,5,Agree,Disagree,"Over the next decade, autonomous cars will raise average welfare in the EU by at least as much as smartphones have over the past decade.","The impact of smartphone is much debated, so doing at least as well is not a very big deal."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,51,Paris School of Economics,f,3,8,Agree,Agree,"Britain’s Labour party recently proposed giving the Bank of England a target of 3% annual labor productivity growth. Consider the following statement:
Central banks cannot significantly increase productivity growth over a ten year horizon, except perhaps by promoting macroeconomic stability.",Recent studies have suggested a link between monetary conditions and productivity growth. However this is still much discussed.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,52,Paris School of Economics,f,8,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: The European Commission has proposed new rules to ensure that “digital business activities are taxed in a fair and growth-friendly way in the EU”. Consider two statements regarding this proposal:
An EU-wide 3% tax on revenue from digital activities would, on balance, be a good idea.","Probably not the first best, but a witholding tax could help restoring fair competition."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,53,Paris School of Economics,f,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B:
If the EU decides to tax digital service providers, it would be better — given the difficulties of measuring and verifying digital activity — to tax them on the revenue, rather than the profits, that they generate locally.",Profit is even more difficult to localize than revenue.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,54,Paris School of Economics,f,5,6,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"The European Union often uses its antitrust powers to protect EU-based firms from international competition, rather than to promote greater competition in European markets.",Many European firms have been targeted.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,55,Paris School of Economics,f,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Trade with China makes most Europeans better off because, among other advantages, they can buy goods that are made or assembled more cheaply in China.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,56,Paris School of Economics,f,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Some Europeans who work in the production of competing goods, such as clothing and furniture, are made worse off by trade with China.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,57,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question C: If the EU followed the new US steel tariffs by imposing similar EU tariffs on steel from China, it would improve Europeans’ welfare.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,58,Paris School of Economics,f,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question A: Assuming it exits its third bailout program this summer without an immediate restructuring or other debt relief, Greece is unlikely to default on its sovereign debt in the coming decade.","It would probably be later, given the maturity of the debt."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,59,Paris School of Economics,f,5,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Greece would be better off if it had decided to exit the euro between 2011 and 2015.,"Posted an external deficit along the crisis, thanks to emergency assistance and Target inflows. Alone, it would have lost more purch power."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,60,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question C: If Greece had defaulted on (or restructured) its private debt in 2010, while also staying within the euro, that combination would have been better for Greece than either exiting the euro or proceeding as it has actually done.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,61,Paris School of Economics,f,9,7,Agree,Disagree,Question A: Bitcoins are more similar to gold than they are to currency.,Except that you cannot make nice necklaces with bitcoins.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,62,Paris School of Economics,f,2,6,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Bitcoins are more similar to gold than they are to Dutch tulips in the 1630s.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,63,Paris School of Economics,f,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,64,Paris School of Economics,f,6,7,Agree,Agree,"Over the past two years, all else equal, the appeal of the US as a destination for immigrants has changed in ways that will likely decrease innovation in the US economy.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,65,Paris School of Economics,f,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: Holding other policies fixed, the average European would be better off if every European country taxed corporate profits at a rate of 20% (based as closely as possible on a common definition of profits).","Economic geography would argue for some rate diversity, possibly with a floor."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,66,Paris School of Economics,f,8,6,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: If other policies were held fixed and every European country taxed corporate profits at a common rate of 20%, then reducing that common rate substantially below 20% would make the average European better off.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,67,Paris School of Economics,f,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,"Question A: All else equal, if corporations throughout Europe set quotas for a minimum number of women board members, the shareholder value of European companies would increase.",I think there are already quotas in a number of countries.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,68,Paris School of Economics,f,1,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: Taking into account the likely effects on investments in human capital by men and women, setting quotas throughout Europe for a minimum number of women board members would generate substantial net benefits for Europeans.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,69,Paris School of Economics,f,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: Subsidizing renewable energy sources is better than taxing fossil fuels, assuming the subsidy or tax would be set at levels that would reduce carbon emissions by an equivalent amount.","Subsidies need to be financed through taxing other tax bases, with new distortions. Better to stick with the polluter-payer principle."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,70,Paris School of Economics,f,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Germany’s solar-energy subsidies to date have produced net social benefits for Germany.,Quite inefficient policy. Coal plants are still alive. Cost passed on households.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,71,Paris School of Economics,f,7,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question C: Solar-energy subsidies to date in Germany and other countries have produced net social benefits for the world.,The problem is less solar-energy subsidies than the phasing out of nuclear power.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,72,Paris School of Economics,f,5,8,Agree,Agree,"Insights from psychology about individual behavior – examples of which include limited rationality, low self-control, or a taste for fairness – predict several important types of observed market outcomes that fully-rational economic models do not.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,73,Paris School of Economics,f,3,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,The influx of refugees into Germany beginning in the summer of 2015 will generate net economic benefits for German citizens over the succeeding decade.,I think it will take more than a decade for the net economic benefits to appear.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,74,Paris School of Economics,f,7,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Holding labor market institutions and job training fixed, rising use of robots and artificial intelligence is likely to increase substantially the number of workers in advanced countries who are unemployed for long periods.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,75,Paris School of Economics,f,7,6,Agree,Agree,Question B: Rising use of robots and artificial intelligence in advanced countries is likely to create benefits large enough that they could be used to compensate those workers who are substantially negatively affected for their lost wages.,"In theory yes. However the workers want jobs, not transfers. Very difficult during the transition."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,76,Paris School of Economics,f,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question A: Consumers will be better off, on balance, if European cities treat firms that provide ride-sharing platforms (such as Uber) as substantively different from taxi firms, and thus not necessarily warranting the same regulation.",Taxi regulation could be adjusted to the new business model; a level playing field is needed.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,77,Paris School of Economics,f,6,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question B: Assuming that taxi and ride-sharing companies were treated as substantively similar — including requirements that they operate on an equal footing regarding safety, insurance and taxation — letting ride-sharing services compete without restrictions on prices or routes would raise consumer welfare.",Ride-sharing platforms need to be regulated to avoid monopoly power related to large network effects.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,78,Paris School of Economics,f,6,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Regardless of how ride-sharing services are treated, existing regulations for traditional taxi firms in many European cities harm consumers by limiting competition.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,79,Paris School of Economics,f,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Revising France’s labor market policies — by reducing employment protection, decentralizing labor negotiations to the firm level, and making training programs more accessible and responsive to labor demands — would, all else equal, increase productivity in France’s economy.","The extensive margin of productivity growth is relatively poor in France + the training system is very unequal, both for youth and adults."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,80,Paris School of Economics,f,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,Question B: Reducing employment protection would reduce the equilibrium unemployment rate in France.,It would reduce employment inequalities but maybe not the aggregate unemployment rate which depends also on a better matching process.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,81,Paris School of Economics,f,6,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: The ECB's asset purchases over the past two years have reduced the threat of deflation in the euro area as a whole.,
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,82,Paris School of Economics,f,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: If the economic outlook in the euro area becomes less favorable, then increasing the ECB's asset purchase program (in size or duration) would substantially increase the euro area's economic growth over the following five years.",The key issue is to maintain nominal interest rates below nominal growth during a certain period.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,83,Paris School of Economics,f,9,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, absent any inside information, an equity investor can expect to do better by holding a well-diversified, low-fee, passive index fund than by holding a few stocks.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,84,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Without changes in policy, a rising share of people who are over age 65 will exert a substantial downward influence on per capita real GDP in western European countries.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,85,Paris School of Economics,f,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: In European countries where the share of those over 65 is rising, there are net social benefits to adjusting retirement ages for state-financed (including pay-as-you-go) pension systems upwards, so that revised retirement ages better reflect longer life expectancies.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,86,Paris School of Economics,f,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, there are substantial advantages to having much of Europe’s human capital and infrastructure for international financial activity clustered in a single city, as they are at present in London.","There are economies of scale, but concentration also increases the risks related to size and possible collusion."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,87,Paris School of Economics,f,4,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: All else equal, Britain’s rules on hiring, firing and working hours are significantly more conducive to financial activity than those in other large European countries.",Differences in labour flexibility are less marked for executives. Other factors are also important for the location of financial activity.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,88,Paris School of Economics,f,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Setting the EU rules aside, and assuming it would take 2.5% of Italy’s GDP to recapitalize its banks, the Italian government would improve financial stability in Europe if it injected this amount of public funds into its banks.","Some public recapitalization is actually needed, although maybe as much as 2.5% of GDP, and not outside EU rules."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,89,Paris School of Economics,f,9,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: If Italy were to inject public funds into its banks without imposing losses on at least some claimants, an important cost would be the effect on future incentives (economic or political) in Europe.","In practice it is not possible to move directly from a bail out to a bail in regime, but at least the direction should be made clear."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,90,Paris School of Economics,f,8,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"On the whole, the shift from state to private ownership of many industrial assets in central and eastern European countries after communism has increased productivity in those countries.",Only after several years of depression.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,91,Paris School of Economics,f,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: Freer movement of people to live and work across borders within Europe has made the average western European citizen better off since the 1980s.,Existing studies conclude to higher GDP and net tax receipts in immigration countries.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,92,Paris School of Economics,f,7,6,Uncertain,Disagree,Question B: Freer movement of people to live and work across borders within Europe has made many low-skilled western European citizens worse off since the 1980s.,Some countries have failed to carry out the needed solcial investment and/or to compensate the losers.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,93,Paris School of Economics,f,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Question A: Freer movement of goods and services across borders within Europe has made the average western European citizen better off since the 1980s.,"Although there is no counter-factual, many studies suggest that European integration has increased average GDP per capita."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,94,Paris School of Economics,f,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Freer movement of goods and services across borders within Europe has made many low-skilled western European citizens worse off since the 1980s.,"In most Western EU countries, inequalities of disposable income have not increased at least up to the crisis."
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,95,Paris School of Economics,f,6,8,Uncertain,Strongly Agree,"In general, using more congestion charges in crowded transportation networks — such as higher tolls during peak travel times in cities, and peak fees for airplane takeoff and landing slots — and using the proceeds to lower other taxes would make citizens on average better off.",The citizens would likely be better off if the congestion charges were used to invest in public transportation.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,96,Paris School of Economics,f,8,6,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a country typically generates domestic benefits that outweigh the costs to the country providing the incentives.,Even in distressed areas this kind of policy gets poor results.
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,97,Paris School of Economics,f,9,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Europe as a whole benefits when European cities or countries compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,Tax competition cannot be welfare enhancing as long as it is distorted (e.g. due to profit shifting).
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,98,Paris School of Economics,f,9,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because of the Brexit vote's outcome, the UK's real per-capita income level is likely to be lower a decade from now than it would have been otherwise.",
Agnès Bénassy-Quéré,99,Paris School of Economics,f,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Because of the Brexit vote's outcome, the rest of the EU's real per-capita income level is likely to be lower a decade from now than it would have been otherwise.","The impact on the EU is likely to be less than that on the UK, except if Brexit is the beginning of a progressive breakup of the EU."
Antoinette Schoar,1,MIT,f,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question A: Germany's current account surplus is undesirable even from a purely German viewpoint: the country would be better off if, for example, it ran a smaller primary surplus, in turn leading to a smaller current account surplus.",
Antoinette Schoar,2,MIT,f,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question B: The Eurozone would be in better shape if fiscal policy were more expansionary, which would allow monetary policy to be slightly less so.",
Antoinette Schoar,3,MIT,f,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question C: If there is a recession in the Eurozone, it will be essential to have a coordinated fiscal expansion.",
Antoinette Schoar,4,MIT,f,8,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question A: The European Union goal of reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 will be a major drag on economic growth.,
Antoinette Schoar,5,MIT,f,7,6,Disagree,Agree,Question B: Carbon taxes are a better way to implement climate policy than cap-and-trade.,Either can be effective depending on the enforcement environment and industry structure within a country.
Antoinette Schoar,6,MIT,f,8,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question C: A carbon border tax targeting imports from non-EU countries with less strict climate policies is likely to harm developing economies.,Short term: Increases costs and investments in less polluting technologies. Longer term: These countries are at risk from climate change
Antoinette Schoar,7,MIT,f,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: Following the UK election result, the certainty that the country is going to leave the European Union will provide a substantial short-term boost to the UK economy.",
Antoinette Schoar,8,MIT,f,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Given that the transition period currently expires at the end of 2020, there is still a considerable risk that the UK will leave the European Union without a trade agreement.",
Antoinette Schoar,9,MIT,f,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question C: Leaving the European Union without a trade agreement would have a large negative impact on the UK economy.,
Antoinette Schoar,10,MIT,f,7,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Under current policies on climate change, the associated physical risks (such as those arising from total seasonal rainfall and sea level changes, and increased frequency, severity, and correlation of extreme weather events) will be at most a very small factor in monetary policy decisions over the next decade.",monetary policy is not a useful tool to tackle climate risks.

Francesco Giavazzi,79,Bocconi,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Revising France’s labor market policies — by reducing employment protection, decentralizing labor negotiations to the firm level, and making training programs more accessible and responsive to labor demands — would, all else equal, increase productivity in France’s economy.",The positive experience of the Italian jobs Act
Francesco Giavazzi,80,Bocconi,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: Reducing employment protection would reduce the equilibrium unemployment rate in France.,
Francesco Giavazzi,81,Bocconi,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: The ECB's asset purchases over the past two years have reduced the threat of deflation in the euro area as a whole.,Hard to distinguish between role of purchases and of negative rates (via the exchange rate channel). Both probably helped
Francesco Giavazzi,82,Bocconi,m,7,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: If the economic outlook in the euro area becomes less favorable, then increasing the ECB's asset purchase program (in size or duration) would substantially increase the euro area's economic growth over the following five years.",purchases have achieved what they were supposed to. Unlikely they can do more--though in the case described they should not be removed
Francesco Giavazzi,83,Bocconi,m,NA,9,Did Not Answer,Strongly Agree,"In general, absent any inside information, an equity investor can expect to do better by holding a well-diversified, low-fee, passive index fund than by holding a few stocks.",
Francesco Giavazzi,84,Bocconi,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Without changes in policy, a rising share of people who are over age 65 will exert a substantial downward influence on per capita real GDP in western European countries.",indeed it depends on policies. Aging accompanied by improvemente in human capital of the youth could have the opposite effect.
Francesco Giavazzi,85,Bocconi,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: In European countries where the share of those over 65 is rising, there are net social benefits to adjusting retirement ages for state-financed (including pay-as-you-go) pension systems upwards, so that revised retirement ages better reflect longer life expectancies.",in some countries (e.g. Italy) retirement age isindedd already indexed to average life expectancy
Francesco Giavazzi,86,Bocconi,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, there are substantial advantages to having much of Europe’s human capital and infrastructure for international financial activity clustered in a single city, as they are at present in London.",Enrico Morretti's work on cities (The New Geography of Jobs) is a good starting point
Francesco Giavazzi,87,Bocconi,m,1,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: All else equal, Britain’s rules on hiring, firing and working hours are significantly more conducive to financial activity than those in other large European countries.",no brainer
Francesco Giavazzi,88,Bocconi,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question A: Setting the EU rules aside, and assuming it would take 2.5% of Italy’s GDP to recapitalize its banks, the Italian government would improve financial stability in Europe if it injected this amount of public funds into its banks.",zombie banks would eventually drive Italy out of the euro
Francesco Giavazzi,89,Bocconi,m,9,8,Disagree,Agree,"Question B: If Italy were to inject public funds into its banks without imposing losses on at least some claimants, an important cost would be the effect on future incentives (economic or political) in Europe.",it has happened elsewhere in Europe and there is no dign of a serious deterioration of incentives
Francesco Giavazzi,90,Bocconi,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"On the whole, the shift from state to private ownership of many industrial assets in central and eastern European countries after communism has increased productivity in those countries.",
Francesco Giavazzi,91,Bocconi,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: Freer movement of people to live and work across borders within Europe has made the average western European citizen better off since the 1980s.,
Francesco Giavazzi,92,Bocconi,m,1,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Freer movement of people to live and work across borders within Europe has made many low-skilled western European citizens worse off since the 1980s.,"again the question is about movements within europe, thus no doubts"
Francesco Giavazzi,93,Bocconi,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Question A: Freer movement of goods and services across borders within Europe has made the average western European citizen better off since the 1980s.,the questions asks about movements WITHIN Europe: here there is no doubt
Francesco Giavazzi,94,Bocconi,m,10,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Freer movement of goods and services across borders within Europe has made many low-skilled western European citizens worse off since the 1980s.,"again the question is about trade within europe, thus no doubts"
Francesco Giavazzi,95,Bocconi,m,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Strongly Agree,"In general, using more congestion charges in crowded transportation networks — such as higher tolls during peak travel times in cities, and peak fees for airplane takeoff and landing slots — and using the proceeds to lower other taxes would make citizens on average better off.",
Francesco Giavazzi,96,Bocconi,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a country typically generates domestic benefits that outweigh the costs to the country providing the incentives.,
Francesco Giavazzi,97,Bocconi,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Disagree,Question B: Europe as a whole benefits when European cities or countries compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,
Francesco Giavazzi,98,Bocconi,m,5,8,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Because of the Brexit vote's outcome, the UK's real per-capita income level is likely to be lower a decade from now than it would have been otherwise.",

Franklin Allen,1,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Germany's current account surplus is undesirable even from a purely German viewpoint: the country would be better off if, for example, it ran a smaller primary surplus, in turn leading to a smaller current account surplus.",Depends what the money is spent on. Germany is probably underinvesting in infrastructure and education.
Franklin Allen,2,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question B: The Eurozone would be in better shape if fiscal policy were more expansionary, which would allow monetary policy to be slightly less so.",Again it depends on what the money is being spent on with the expanded fiscal policy relative to what is the optimal public expenditure.
Franklin Allen,3,Imperial College London,m,5,8,Disagree,Agree,"Question C: If there is a recession in the Eurozone, it will be essential to have a coordinated fiscal expansion.",Not clear in the long run that policy interventions of this kind are beneficial. Again depends on how productively spending is.
Franklin Allen,4,Imperial College London,m,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: The European Union goal of reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 will be a major drag on economic growth.,There are a lot of opportunities building new businesses from the climate change initiative. The time horizon is long enough for it to be ok
Franklin Allen,5,Imperial College London,m,3,6,Uncertain,Agree,Question B: Carbon taxes are a better way to implement climate policy than cap-and-trade.,This is an interesting question. I do not know the research in this area well.
Franklin Allen,6,Imperial College London,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question C: A carbon border tax targeting imports from non-EU countries with less strict climate policies is likely to harm developing economies.,In the short run there may be negative effects unless there is a long lead in time. In the long run it will help climate change.
Franklin Allen,7,Imperial College London,m,7,7,Agree,Disagree,"Question A: Following the UK election result, the certainty that the country is going to leave the European Union will provide a substantial short-term boost to the UK economy.",Investment has been low since the Brexit vote. Now there is more clarity after the election it should increase.
Franklin Allen,8,Imperial College London,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Given that the transition period currently expires at the end of 2020, there is still a considerable risk that the UK will leave the European Union without a trade agreement.",The law outlawing extension appears to be a negotiating strategy. There is a risk that they don't the deal.
Franklin Allen,9,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Disagree,Agree,Question C: Leaving the European Union without a trade agreement would have a large negative impact on the UK economy.,I think there is likely to be a negative short term effect but in the medium and long term it is not clear what will happen.
Franklin Allen,10,Imperial College London,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,"Question A: Under current policies on climate change, the associated physical risks (such as those arising from total seasonal rainfall and sea level changes, and increased frequency, severity, and correlation of extreme weather events) will be at most a very small factor in monetary policy decisions over the next decade.",
Franklin Allen,11,Imperial College London,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,Question B: The physical risks associated with climate change under current policies are likely to threaten financial stability over the next decade.,
Franklin Allen,12,Imperial College London,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: Europeans would benefit more from an extra €1 billion of public R&D spent through existing (public) channels than from an extra €1 billion of private R&D spent through existing (private) channels, all else equal.",It depends significantly on the country and what exactly the money would be spent on in both public and private cases.
Franklin Allen,13,Imperial College London,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Europeans would benefit more from an extra €1 billion of public medical research spent through existing (public) channels than from an extra €1 billion of private medical research spent through existing (private) channels, all else equal.",Private research tends to spent on rich world lifestyle medical problems while public research can focus on deadly diseases like TB.
Franklin Allen,14,Imperial College London,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for answering some long unsettled questions in development economics research.,RCTs are a very good way in certain circumstances to establish whether certain business strategies and public policies are beneficial.
Franklin Allen,15,Imperial College London,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for making significant progress in poverty reduction.,They can help identify the uses for new technologies and how they can best be implemented.
Franklin Allen,16,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Having companies run to maximize shareholder value creates significant negative externalities for workers and communities.,I think the issue of stakeholder governance is a very important and much understudied subject. It has been difficult to publish papers.
Franklin Allen,17,Imperial College London,m,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: Appropriately managed corporations could create significantly greater value than they currently do for a range of stakeholders – including workers, suppliers, customers and community members – with small impacts on shareholder value.",Again very understudied.
Franklin Allen,18,Imperial College London,m,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question C:
Effective mechanisms for boards of directors to ensure that CEOs act in ways that balance the interests of all stakeholders would be straightforward to introduce.",I think it will be very difficult to do in practice. The German system of codetermination may be better.
Franklin Allen,19,Imperial College London,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,Question A: Rising inequality is straining the health of liberal democracy.,
Franklin Allen,20,Imperial College London,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,Question B: Enacting more redistributive expenditures and policies would be likely to limit the rise of populism in Europe.,
Franklin Allen,21,Imperial College London,m,NA,7,Did Not Answer,Agree,"Question C: European governments should allocate more resources to policies that would be likely to limit the rise of populism in Europe, even if it means higher public debt or lower public spending in other areas.",
Franklin Allen,22,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: At this point, there is little that the European Central Bank can do to increase or maintain output in the Eurozone.",It is probably close to the limits of what it can achieve using previous tools. But there may be new ones they can come up with.
Franklin Allen,23,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: When the economy is operating below its potential, larger fiscal deficits are likely to increase demand and output.",Maybe in the short run but in the long run good investment decisions associated with innovation are likely to have more effect.
Franklin Allen,24,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question C: When the economy is operating below its potential and monetary policy is at the effective lower bound, fiscal policy should prioritize increasing output over decreasing public debt.",It depends on the circumstances of the country. If it is not very indebted and public investment would be beneficial then it makes sense.
Franklin Allen,25,Imperial College London,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,Question A: Selecting candidates for membership of the ECB Executive Board based primarily on nationality ahead of competence is likely to have a negative effect on the quality of monetary policy in the Eurozone.,"Competence is clearly extremely important. However, in a severe Eurozone crisis understanding key countries' position may also be important"
Franklin Allen,26,Imperial College London,m,6,8,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: Although the central bank can never be an entirely technocratic institution, the selection process for the ECB President and members of the Executive Board is significantly worsened by intergovernmental trade-offs involving appointments to other European institutions.","If all the positions were held by male northern Europeans, it would not be good for the democratic legitimacy of the Union."
Franklin Allen,27,Imperial College London,m,7,5,Disagree,Disagree,"On bids for infrastructure projects, the average European would be better off if Europe’s governments favored European firms over Chinese firms (or firms from any other country with non-profit-related geopolitical strategies) — even if it means sometimes choosing a higher-cost bidder.","For 5G, high speed trains, etc., Chinese technology is better than European, US or Japanese. It would be a shame for Euope not to use it."
Franklin Allen,28,Imperial College London,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,Question A: Breaking the “doom loop” — a negative spiral that can result when banks hold sovereign bonds and governments bail out banks — would increase the stability of European economies in the event of another financial crisis.,"The doom loop is a real problem still, particularly for some southern European countries."
Franklin Allen,29,Imperial College London,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,Question B: Regulators should try to break the doom loop by assigning positive risk weights — in calculating banks’ capital requirements — to banks’ holdings of domestic and other Eurozone sovereign bonds.,I think this would be helpful.
Franklin Allen,30,Imperial College London,m,7,8,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question C: Breaking the doom loop would impose substantial costs on powerful political constituencies.,It would be interesting to see exactly what the political opposition would be to this measure.
Franklin Allen,31,Imperial College London,m,NA,5,Did Not Answer,Disagree,"Residents of big European cities would be better off, on balance, if governments did more to counter gentrification, for example by using rent and other housing subsidies, public housing investments, zoning regulations, or similar policies.",
Franklin Allen,32,Imperial College London,m,5,8,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: A common European deposit insurance scheme, once fully implemented, would increase the stability of European economies in the event of another financial crisis.","Theoretically it can go both ways as deposit insurance can increase risk taking. Empirically there is some evidence crises can increase.
-see background information here"
Franklin Allen,33,Imperial College London,m,6,8,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: A common European deposit insurance scheme, once fully implemented, would increase the likelihood of another financial crisis in Europe.","Complicated issue because of the effect of deposit insurance on risk taking.
-see background information here"
Franklin Allen,34,Imperial College London,m,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: Overall, public spending on the arts in Europe creates benefits that exceed the deadweight loss caused by taxation to fund it.",It's difficult issue involving both funding of public goods and inequality issues.
Franklin Allen,35,Imperial College London,m,4,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: Additional public spending on the arts in Europe would create incremental benefits that exceed the deadweight loss caused by taxation to fund it.,Ascertaining the optimal level is again very difficult.
Franklin Allen,36,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: The average European is better off if Europe’s competition authorities let firms merge into European champions in their sectors, even it weakens competition.",I would say it depends on the extent of global competition and the amount of access to EU markets.
Franklin Allen,37,Imperial College London,m,5,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question B: If China and other countries use policies that create giant international firms, then the average European is better off if Europe's competition authorities let firms merge into European champions in their sectors, even it weakens competition.",Again it depends on global versus local competition.
Franklin Allen,38,Imperial College London,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded European firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,This is an interesting trade-off. I'm afraid I am not up on the literature enough to express a meaningful opinion.
Franklin Allen,39,Imperial College London,m,5,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: A switch from quarterly to annual earnings reports would, on net, benefit shareholders of European firms.",This is an interesting trade-off. I am afraid I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about this to give a meaningful opinion.
Franklin Allen,40,Imperial College London,m,4,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: To the extent that public corporations pursue social and environmental initiatives, they tend to achieve higher risk-adjusted (private) returns than otherwise similar corporations that pursue such initiatives less.",Not sure of the entire literature in this field. Would guess there are a range of results here.
Franklin Allen,41,Imperial College London,m,5,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: To the extent that Norway’s global government pension fund makes investments for social and environmental objectives — apart from investments that would bring the highest expected risk-adjusted returns — it improves the welfare of Norwegians.,Not very knowledgeable about the current ESG policies of Norwegian Global Pension fund.
Franklin Allen,42,Imperial College London,m,5,6,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: The fiscal rules of the European Union should give more flexibility to member countries.,There are arguments both ways. Not fully persuaded either way.
Franklin Allen,43,Imperial College London,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: The Italian budget for 2019 that the European Commission rejected in October would have increased Italy’s risk of fiscal insolvency substantially.,Italy has significant fiscal problems. They need to get their debt under control.
Franklin Allen,44,Imperial College London,m,6,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question C: If France runs a 2019 budget deficit of around 3.4% of GDP, as announced by President Macron’s government, France’s risk of fiscal insolvency will increase substantially.",France's fiscal situation is still under control. The problem is the effect on the Commission's interaction with Italy.
Franklin Allen,45,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: Capping the number of ride-sharing drivers as is being discussed in New York City, Chicago and London will make the average resident in that city worse off.","Complicated issue with many factors involved including price, convenience, availability, safety, and so forth,"
Franklin Allen,46,Imperial College London,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B:
To achieve a given level of congestion, it would be better to use taxes for driving that vary based on the level of congestion, rather than limiting the number of ride-sharing vehicles.",Taxing road use is is good way of dealing with congestion. Main downside is income distribution so could use revenues for public transport.
Franklin Allen,47,Imperial College London,m,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,People who migrated to Europe between 2015 and 2018 are likely — over the next two decades — to contribute more in taxes paid than they receive in benefits and public services.,I'm not well informed about the demographics of all EU immigrants in the time period considered. Usually immigrants provide net benefits.
Franklin Allen,48,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Ideas are nonrival, so increasing returns to scale is an essential feature of technological change in a market economy.",Not exactly sure what the question is suggesting.
Franklin Allen,49,Imperial College London,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Voters overestimate the effect that current governments have on their economies’ concurrent economic performance.,The lags in terms of the effects of policy are uncertain and probably highly variable. It seems unlikely that voters understand this well.
Franklin Allen,50,Imperial College London,m,4,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Over the next decade, autonomous cars will raise average welfare in the EU by at least as much as smartphones have over the past decade.",Autonomous cars may take some time before they are widely used.
Franklin Allen,51,Imperial College London,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Britain’s Labour party recently proposed giving the Bank of England a target of 3% annual labor productivity growth. Consider the following statement:
Central banks cannot significantly increase productivity growth over a ten year horizon, except perhaps by promoting macroeconomic stability.","As far as I know, there's not much evidence that central bank policies are very effective in affecting productivity."
Franklin Allen,52,Imperial College London,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: The European Commission has proposed new rules to ensure that “digital business activities are taxed in a fair and growth-friendly way in the EU”. Consider two statements regarding this proposal:
An EU-wide 3% tax on revenue from digital activities would, on balance, be a good idea.",The digital companies need to be taxed. This seems the best way to do it that I have heard.
Franklin Allen,53,Imperial College London,m,7,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B:
If the EU decides to tax digital service providers, it would be better — given the difficulties of measuring and verifying digital activity — to tax them on the revenue, rather than the profits, that they generate locally.",Profits are fairly meaningless for these companies since they can use accounting charges to move the profits to very low tax rate places.
Franklin Allen,54,Imperial College London,m,3,6,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,"The European Union often uses its antitrust powers to protect EU-based firms from international competition, rather than to promote greater competition in European markets.",I would say the evidence is mixed and I do not enough about it to draw a reasonable conclusion.
Franklin Allen,55,Imperial College London,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Trade with China makes most Europeans better off because, among other advantages, they can buy goods that are made or assembled more cheaply in China.","By and large, I agree with free trade. The question is well phrased to avoid some of the downsides of free trade."
Franklin Allen,56,Imperial College London,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Some Europeans who work in the production of competing goods, such as clothing and furniture, are made worse off by trade with China.","In the short run this is often true. In the medium and long term, it's more difficult to say. Retraining is not that successful so far."
Franklin Allen,57,Imperial College London,m,6,7,Disagree,Strongly Disagree,"Question C: If the EU followed the new US steel tariffs by imposing similar EU tariffs on steel from China, it would improve Europeans’ welfare.","Contrary to what President Trump said, outcomes of trade wars are difficult to predict but are probably not good for anybody."
Franklin Allen,58,Imperial College London,m,7,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: Assuming it exits its third bailout program this summer without an immediate restructuring or other debt relief, Greece is unlikely to default on its sovereign debt in the coming decade.",I would say there is a great deal of uncertainty about this with much depending on how things develop in the Eurozone in the coming years.
Franklin Allen,59,Imperial College London,m,6,7,Agree,Disagree,Question B: Greece would be better off if it had decided to exit the euro between 2011 and 2015.,It has suffered a punishing depression and has only recently started growing. It would have grown much faster outside the Eurozone.
Franklin Allen,60,Imperial College London,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: If Greece had defaulted on (or restructured) its private debt in 2010, while also staying within the euro, that combination would have been better for Greece than either exiting the euro or proceeding as it has actually done.",It would have removed the debt overhang and could have grown much faster as a result.
Franklin Allen,61,Imperial College London,m,6,7,Agree,Disagree,Question A: Bitcoins are more similar to gold than they are to currency.,At the moment Bitcoin is more of an investment than a medium of exchange and so is closer to gold. The reason is the price volatility.
Franklin Allen,62,Imperial College London,m,6,6,Agree,Disagree,Question B: Bitcoins are more similar to gold than they are to Dutch tulips in the 1630s.,"I think Bitcoin is not necessarily a bubble since it does have uses, eg, transferring value from Venezuela to the US."
Franklin Allen,63,Imperial College London,m,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).",
Franklin Allen,64,Imperial College London,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Over the past two years, all else equal, the appeal of the US as a destination for immigrants has changed in ways that will likely decrease innovation in the US economy.",Trump's election has put off many creative people who might otherwise be interested in moving to the US.
Franklin Allen,65,Imperial College London,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Disagree,"Question A: Holding other policies fixed, the average European would be better off if every European country taxed corporate profits at a rate of 20% (based as closely as possible on a common definition of profits).",
Franklin Allen,66,Imperial College London,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: If other policies were held fixed and every European country taxed corporate profits at a common rate of 20%, then reducing that common rate substantially below 20% would make the average European better off.",
Franklin Allen,67,Imperial College London,m,3,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: All else equal, if corporations throughout Europe set quotas for a minimum number of women board members, the shareholder value of European companies would increase.",I am not knowledgeable about the evidence in this area. Setting quotas is a good idea in my view but not because of value increase.
Franklin Allen,68,Imperial College London,m,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Taking into account the likely effects on investments in human capital by men and women, setting quotas throughout Europe for a minimum number of women board members would generate substantial net benefits for Europeans.",I think there would be long term benefits of quotas for this kind of reason.
Franklin Allen,69,Imperial College London,m,6,6,Agree,Disagree,"Question A: Subsidizing renewable energy sources is better than taxing fossil fuels, assuming the subsidy or tax would be set at levels that would reduce carbon emissions by an equivalent amount.",There seem to be strong learning by doing effects. Subsidies can help target these where these effects are largest.
Franklin Allen,70,Imperial College London,m,6,5,Agree,Disagree,Question B: Germany’s solar-energy subsidies to date have produced net social benefits for Germany.,The quicker we get up the learning curve for these technologies the better.
Franklin Allen,71,Imperial College London,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question C: Solar-energy subsidies to date in Germany and other countries have produced net social benefits for the world.,Not so clear solar-power is the best alternative for Germany. I am afraid I don't know enough about the technologies and Germany's climate.
Franklin Allen,72,Imperial College London,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Insights from psychology about individual behavior – examples of which include limited rationality, low self-control, or a taste for fairness – predict several important types of observed market outcomes that fully-rational economic models do not.",I think this is true in many markets. In financial markets it may be less true because of the money at stake but they matter there too.
Franklin Allen,73,Imperial College London,m,6,6,Agree,Uncertain,The influx of refugees into Germany beginning in the summer of 2015 will generate net economic benefits for German citizens over the succeeding decade.,I am not very well informed on the skill sets of the refugees that have been allowed to stay. In general I think immigration is beneficial.
Franklin Allen,74,Imperial College London,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,"Question A: Holding labor market institutions and job training fixed, rising use of robots and artificial intelligence is likely to increase substantially the number of workers in advanced countries who are unemployed for long periods.",
Franklin Allen,75,Imperial College London,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,Question B: Rising use of robots and artificial intelligence in advanced countries is likely to create benefits large enough that they could be used to compensate those workers who are substantially negatively affected for their lost wages.,
Franklin Allen,76,Imperial College London,m,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Consumers will be better off, on balance, if European cities treat firms that provide ride-sharing platforms (such as Uber) as substantively different from taxi firms, and thus not necessarily warranting the same regulation.",Uber provides a different kind of service to regular taxi services that helps consumers. Leck of worker's rights may be a problem though.
Franklin Allen,77,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Assuming that taxi and ride-sharing companies were treated as substantively similar — including requirements that they operate on an equal footing regarding safety, insurance and taxation — letting ride-sharing services compete without restrictions on prices or routes would raise consumer welfare.",This seems an area where competition would be beneficial.
Franklin Allen,78,Imperial College London,m,5,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question C: Regardless of how ride-sharing services are treated, existing regulations for traditional taxi firms in many European cities harm consumers by limiting competition.",Trade-off of worker'w rights and consumers benefits is a difficult one.
Franklin Allen,79,Imperial College London,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Revising France’s labor market policies — by reducing employment protection, decentralizing labor negotiations to the firm level, and making training programs more accessible and responsive to labor demands — would, all else equal, increase productivity in France’s economy.","Giving flexibility should improve things in the long run. The short run effects may be more problematic if there is a lot of dissent,"
Franklin Allen,80,Imperial College London,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Reducing employment protection would reduce the equilibrium unemployment rate in France.,This seems to have been the case in other countries. The unions response may lead to a different outcome in the case of France.
Franklin Allen,81,Imperial College London,m,6,7,Uncertain,Agree,Question A: The ECB's asset purchases over the past two years have reduced the threat of deflation in the euro area as a whole.,It's difficult to know the effect of these asset purchases on consumer price inflation.
Franklin Allen,82,Imperial College London,m,5,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question B: If the economic outlook in the euro area becomes less favorable, then increasing the ECB's asset purchase program (in size or duration) would substantially increase the euro area's economic growth over the following five years.",It seems quite uncertain to me what the effect on growth of the asset purchases. It will depend among other things on how they are unwound
Franklin Allen,83,Imperial College London,m,8,9,Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, absent any inside information, an equity investor can expect to do better by holding a well-diversified, low-fee, passive index fund than by holding a few stocks.","In the absence of inside information, on average a diversified strategy should do better unless the person has good judgment."
Franklin Allen,84,Imperial College London,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Without changes in policy, a rising share of people who are over age 65 will exert a substantial downward influence on per capita real GDP in western European countries.",It depends on how easy it is for them to keep working. The easier it is the less likely this scenario will unfold.
Franklin Allen,85,Imperial College London,m,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: In European countries where the share of those over 65 is rising, there are net social benefits to adjusting retirement ages for state-financed (including pay-as-you-go) pension systems upwards, so that revised retirement ages better reflect longer life expectancies.","Yes, people need to work longer given the demographic distribution and increased longevity."

Franklin Allen,96,Imperial College London,m,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a country typically generates domestic benefits that outweigh the costs to the country providing the incentives.,Difficult to answer such a general question - more information about the particular circumstances is required.
Franklin Allen,97,Imperial College London,m,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Europe as a whole benefits when European cities or countries compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,Small countries have an incentive to offer low rates since their fixed costs are smaller.

Hélène Rey,5,London Business School,f,9,6,Agree,Agree,Question B: Carbon taxes are a better way to implement climate policy than cap-and-trade.,Best way is predictably rising carbon price path with redistribution of carbon dividend and accompanying investments
Hélène Rey,6,London Business School,f,8,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question C: A carbon border tax targeting imports from non-EU countries with less strict climate policies is likely to harm developing economies.,Depends on accompanying policies: technological transfers and aid to mitigate costs could help a lot.
Hélène Rey,7,London Business School,f,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: Following the UK election result, the certainty that the country is going to leave the European Union will provide a substantial short-term boost to the UK economy.","There is great uncertainty about the path that will be chosen, from no deal to soft Brexit."

Hélène Rey,16,London Business School,f,8,7,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Having companies run to maximize shareholder value creates significant negative externalities for workers and communities.,For example carbon is not properly priced.

Effective mechanisms for boards of directors to ensure that CEOs act in ways that balance the interests of all stakeholders would be straightforward to introduce.",Needs a lot of information and to design proper incentive mechanisms
Hélène Rey,19,London Business School,f,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: Rising inequality is straining the health of liberal democracy.,"Populist parties/ extreme right, left exploit anger and resentment (Brexit, Trump, Liga, etc...). Lobbies/large donations pervert democracy."

But level paying field is required. How does one deal with China on this?
Hélène Rey,38,London Business School,f,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded European firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,

Jan Pieter Krahnen,18,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question C:
Effective mechanisms for boards of directors to ensure that CEOs act in ways that balance the interests of all stakeholders would be straightforward to introduce.",Long term profitability will not be maximized when other stakeholders' interests are manifestly violated.

Jan Pieter Krahnen,22,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,6,7,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: At this point, there is little that the European Central Bank can do to increase or maintain output in the Eurozone.",The ECB can influence output via interest rates if and only if the investment function is monotonic everywhere.

Jan Pieter Krahnen,26,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,6,8,Disagree,Agree,"Question B: Although the central bank can never be an entirely technocratic institution, the selection process for the ECB President and members of the Executive Board is significantly worsened by intergovernmental trade-offs involving appointments to other European institutions.","The phrase overstates the effective influence of trade-offs.

Jan Pieter Krahnen,27,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,6,5,Disagree,Disagree,"On bids for infrastructure projects, the average European would be better off if Europe’s governments favored European firms over Chinese firms (or firms from any other country with non-profit-related geopolitical strategies) — even if it means sometimes choosing a higher-cost bidder.","The response to geopolitical interests is a wise strong set of conditionalities if awarded, rather than exclusion from the bidding process."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,28,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,7,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: Breaking the “doom loop” — a negative spiral that can result when banks hold sovereign bonds and governments bail out banks — would increase the stability of European economies in the event of another financial crisis.,"In the Eurozone, banks' home bias creates bankruptcy risk because states cannot print the money needed to redeem their debt."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,29,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,6,8,Agree,Agree,Question B: Regulators should try to break the doom loop by assigning positive risk weights — in calculating banks’ capital requirements — to banks’ holdings of domestic and other Eurozone sovereign bonds.,"I only weakly agree, because there are second order effects of risk weights, and there are better alternatives, like concentration limits."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,30,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,5,8,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question C: Breaking the doom loop would impose substantial costs on powerful political constituencies.,Second order (political) effects of changing risk weights are only poorly understood.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,31,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,6,5,Agree,Disagree,"Residents of big European cities would be better off, on balance, if governments did more to counter gentrification, for example by using rent and other housing subsidies, public housing investments, zoning regulations, or similar policies.","Too homogeneous a neighborhood in inner cities, as wel as in ""les banlieues"", may undermine cohesion and solidarity in society at large."

Jan Pieter Krahnen,38,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded European firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,The point is that Board-level brain-time needed to justify volatile results is reduced to an -arguably- more reasonable time span.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,39,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,6,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: A switch from quarterly to annual earnings reports would, on net, benefit shareholders of European firms.",Board-level brain time is redirected to longer horizons - which on balance may benefit shareholders.
Jan Pieter Krahnen,40,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,5,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: To the extent that public corporations pursue social and environmental initiatives, they tend to achieve higher risk-adjusted (private) returns than otherwise similar corporations that pursue such initiatives less.","It is an unlikely combination, doing good and having private benefits too."

Jan Pieter Krahnen,46,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,5,8,Disagree,Agree,"Question B:
To achieve a given level of congestion, it would be better to use taxes for driving that vary based on the level of congestion, rather than limiting the number of ride-sharing vehicles.","The marginal cost of adding or subtracting vehicles instantly, according to traffic status, is lower with ride-sharers than with cabs."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,47,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,5,6,Agree,Uncertain,People who migrated to Europe between 2015 and 2018 are likely — over the next two decades — to contribute more in taxes paid than they receive in benefits and public services.,"As employment rate among migrants goes up over time, and much of taxation is indirect anyway, chances are that the statement comes true."

Central banks cannot significantly increase productivity growth over a ten year horizon, except perhaps by promoting macroeconomic stability.","Quite an absurd suggestion, vastly overestimating what monetary policy can achieve - in the end frustrating central bankers and the public."
Jan Pieter Krahnen,52,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,7,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: The European Commission has proposed new rules to ensure that “digital business activities are taxed in a fair and growth-friendly way in the EU”. Consider two statements regarding this proposal:
An EU-wide 3% tax on revenue from digital activities would, on balance, be a good idea.","A ""fair"" digital tax should allocate the tax base (profits) virtually among producer and consumer countries; a 3% tax may start negotiations"

If the EU decides to tax digital service providers, it would be better — given the difficulties of measuring and verifying digital activity — to tax them on the revenue, rather than the profits, that they generate locally.","Yes, but profit taxation requires negotiations between countries to share the tax base (unlikely to work in todays protectionist world)"
Jan Pieter Krahnen,54,Goethe University Frankfurt,m,5,6,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,"The European Union often uses its antitrust powers to protect EU-based firms from international competition, rather than to promote greater competition in European markets.","A generalized answer to this question needs to be specify a particular industry.

Karl Whelan,36,University College Dublin,m,10,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: The average European is better off if Europe’s competition authorities let firms merge into European champions in their sectors, even it weakens competition.",“European champions” seems to be verbal linguistics to justify undermining competition policy.
Karl Whelan,37,University College Dublin,m,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question B: If China and other countries use policies that create giant international firms, then the average European is better off if Europe's competition authorities let firms merge into European champions in their sectors, even it weakens competition.",There may be some areas with huge economies of scale where this is true (eg aircraft production) but it will not generally be the case.
Karl Whelan,38,University College Dublin,m,6,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded European firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,I can't see any good arguments for this change in reporting frequency having any positive effect on managerial decision making.
Karl Whelan,39,University College Dublin,m,8,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question B: A switch from quarterly to annual earnings reports would, on net, benefit shareholders of European firms.",Shareholders are better off having access to regular information on the companies they own.
Karl Whelan,40,University College Dublin,m,3,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question A: To the extent that public corporations pursue social and environmental initiatives, they tend to achieve higher risk-adjusted (private) returns than otherwise similar corporations that pursue such initiatives less.",Companies most likely see CSP initiatives as part of a broader marketing budget. It may suit some to do more than others.
Karl Whelan,41,University College Dublin,m,5,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: To the extent that Norway’s global government pension fund makes investments for social and environmental objectives — apart from investments that would bring the highest expected risk-adjusted returns — it improves the welfare of Norwegians.,Hard to sum this up with such a short question. All countries have an interest in co-operative behavior that reduces risks of climate change
Karl Whelan,42,University College Dublin,m,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: The fiscal rules of the European Union should give more flexibility to member countries.,The rules should focus on maintaining overall debt sustainability and not on randomly chosen figures (such as deficit limits of 3 percent).
Karl Whelan,43,University College Dublin,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: The Italian budget for 2019 that the European Commission rejected in October would have increased Italy’s risk of fiscal insolvency substantially.,Insolvency risk is driven by loss of market confidence and failure to roll over existing debt. This government is close to provoking this.
Karl Whelan,44,University College Dublin,m,7,6,Disagree,Disagree,"Question C: If France runs a 2019 budget deficit of around 3.4% of GDP, as announced by President Macron’s government, France’s risk of fiscal insolvency will increase substantially.","France has lower debt\GDP and there is far less likelihood of a bond market ""strike"" on buying French debt. 3 percent is an arbitrary limit."
Karl Whelan,45,University College Dublin,m,8,7,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Capping the number of ride-sharing drivers as is being discussed in New York City, Chicago and London will make the average resident in that city worse off.",Arbitrary caps on numbers employed in specific industries are unlikely to ever deliver good outcomes.
Karl Whelan,46,University College Dublin,m,10,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B:
To achieve a given level of congestion, it would be better to use taxes for driving that vary based on the level of congestion, rather than limiting the number of ride-sharing vehicles.",Capping numbers of a specific group of drivers is not an efficient or useful way to deal with congestion.
Karl Whelan,47,University College Dublin,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Uncertain,People who migrated to Europe between 2015 and 2018 are likely — over the next two decades — to contribute more in taxes paid than they receive in benefits and public services.,

The debt is unsustainable (see the recent CEPR report) but there will likely be debt relief thus avoiding an outright default.
Karl Whelan,59,University College Dublin,m,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Greece would be better off if it had decided to exit the euro between 2011 and 2015.,Better to have larger sovereign default in 2011 restoring sustainability and avoiding the excessively tight fiscal policy of 2012 onwards.
Karl Whelan,60,University College Dublin,m,8,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question C: If Greece had defaulted on (or restructured) its private debt in 2010, while also staying within the euro, that combination would have been better for Greece than either exiting the euro or proceeding as it has actually done.","Euro membership provided stability and low interest rates. The damage was done by ""debt denial "" and excessively tight fiscal policy."
Karl Whelan,61,University College Dublin,m,10,7,Agree,Disagree,Question A: Bitcoins are more similar to gold than they are to currency.,On the relative similarity I agree but gold has actual uses (e.g. jewellery) which gives it some value. Bitcoin will likely end up worthless
Karl Whelan,62,University College Dublin,m,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Bitcoins are more similar to gold than they are to Dutch tulips in the 1630s.,The tulips thing was a long time ago and there are various disagreements about it. But yes Bitcoin is more pure speculation than even gold.
Karl Whelan,63,University College Dublin,m,8,6,Agree,Uncertain,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).",The US spends more on healthcare than European countries but covers a small fraction of the population and has inferior health outcomes.

Karl Whelan,73,University College Dublin,m,7,6,Agree,Uncertain,The influx of refugees into Germany beginning in the summer of 2015 will generate net economic benefits for German citizens over the succeeding decade.,Germany has very poor demographics and its population is set to contract.

Karl Whelan,75,University College Dublin,m,NA,6,Did Not Answer,Agree,Question B: Rising use of robots and artificial intelligence in advanced countries is likely to create benefits large enough that they could be used to compensate those workers who are substantially negatively affected for their lost wages.,
Karl Whelan,76,University College Dublin,m,8,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question A: Consumers will be better off, on balance, if European cities treat firms that provide ride-sharing platforms (such as Uber) as substantively different from taxi firms, and thus not necessarily warranting the same regulation.","The business of these firms is not substantively different from taxis, so I don't see why they should be treated differently."
Karl Whelan,77,University College Dublin,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Assuming that taxi and ride-sharing companies were treated as substantively similar — including requirements that they operate on an equal footing regarding safety, insurance and taxation — letting ride-sharing services compete without restrictions on prices or routes would raise consumer welfare.",Imposing restrictions on a particular sub-set of the market is unfair and hurts consumers.
Karl Whelan,78,University College Dublin,m,10,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question C: Regardless of how ride-sharing services are treated, existing regulations for traditional taxi firms in many European cities harm consumers by limiting competition.",Restrictive regulations relating to pricing or quantity supplied are rarely a good idea unless there is a clear market failure.
Karl Whelan,79,University College Dublin,m,4,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Revising France’s labor market policies — by reducing employment protection, decentralizing labor negotiations to the firm level, and making training programs more accessible and responsive to labor demands — would, all else equal, increase productivity in France’s economy.",Probably not a big effect. Would also bring some relatively lower productivity workers into employment This would lower average productivity
Karl Whelan,80,University College Dublin,m,7,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: Reducing employment protection would reduce the equilibrium unemployment rate in France.,It is likely that high levels of employment protection raise the natural rate of unemployment. But this is just one of many factors.
Karl Whelan,81,University College Dublin,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: The ECB's asset purchases over the past two years have reduced the threat of deflation in the euro area as a whole.,QE is complex but most careful research shows it impacts long-term rates. ECB program has definitely reduced sovereign borrowing rates.
Karl Whelan,82,University College Dublin,m,6,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question B: If the economic outlook in the euro area becomes less favorable, then increasing the ECB's asset purchase program (in size or duration) would substantially increase the euro area's economic growth over the following five years.","The disagreement is because of the word ""substantial"".

Karl Whelan,86,University College Dublin,m,5,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, there are substantial advantages to having much of Europe’s human capital and infrastructure for international financial activity clustered in a single city, as they are at present in London.",There may be some wider advantages for Europe due to the clustering of financial service activity in London but it is likely to be small.
Karl Whelan,87,University College Dublin,m,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Agree,"Question B: All else equal, Britain’s rules on hiring, firing and working hours are significantly more conducive to financial activity than those in other large European countries.","I don't believe labour laws in France, Germany or Ireland, for example, will be a deterring factor for financial service firms."
Karl Whelan,88,University College Dublin,m,3,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Setting the EU rules aside, and assuming it would take 2.5% of Italy’s GDP to recapitalize its banks, the Italian government would improve financial stability in Europe if it injected this amount of public funds into its banks.",This may improve financial stability in the short-run but probably sets a bad fiscal precedent for other European governments in the future.
Karl Whelan,89,University College Dublin,m,5,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: If Italy were to inject public funds into its banks without imposing losses on at least some claimants, an important cost would be the effect on future incentives (economic or political) in Europe.",This would undermine the EU's BRRD approach though it always seemed likely loss imposition was more a policy intended for small countries.
Karl Whelan,90,University College Dublin,m,4,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"On the whole, the shift from state to private ownership of many industrial assets in central and eastern European countries after communism has increased productivity in those countries.",Agree but moving from state-sponsored monopolies to badly-regulated private sector monopolies does not do much for the average consumer.

Karl Whelan,92,University College Dublin,m,1,6,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Freer movement of people to live and work across borders within Europe has made many low-skilled western European citizens worse off since the 1980s.,Empirical evidence on effects of migration from Eastern Europe suggest limited effects on wages in the UK for example.
Karl Whelan,93,University College Dublin,m,5,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,Question A: Freer movement of goods and services across borders within Europe has made the average western European citizen better off since the 1980s.,I agree but evidence on productivity suggests that the gains from this kind of liberalisation have been smaller than anticipated.

Trade liberalisation with non-EU areas more important.
Karl Whelan,95,University College Dublin,m,7,8,Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, using more congestion charges in crowded transportation networks — such as higher tolls during peak travel times in cities, and peak fees for airplane takeoff and landing slots — and using the proceeds to lower other taxes would make citizens on average better off.","If we are going to tax things (and we have to) it's best to tax things that have negative effects such as congestion, alcohol, carbon etc."
Karl Whelan,96,University College Dublin,m,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a country typically generates domestic benefits that outweigh the costs to the country providing the incentives.,"This can be true but governments aren't always great at ""picking winners."" Some special local tax rates are probably just bad ideas."
Karl Whelan,97,University College Dublin,m,8,7,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Europe as a whole benefits when European cities or countries compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,This kind of process drives down average corporate tax rates across the EU. There are probably better ways to cut taxes.

Central banks cannot significantly increase productivity growth over a ten year horizon, except perhaps by promoting macroeconomic stability.",I know of no result in the literature suggesting monetary policy would be able to affect technology growth.
Per Krusell,34,Stockholm University,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question A: The European Commission has proposed new rules to ensure that “digital business activities are taxed in a fair and growth-friendly way in the EU”. Consider two statements regarding this proposal:
An EU-wide 3% tax on revenue from digital activities would, on balance, be a good idea.",I simply don’t understand the motivation.
Per Krusell,35,Stockholm University,m,NA,5,No Opinion,Uncertain,"Question B:
If the EU decides to tax digital service providers, it would be better — given the difficulties of measuring and verifying digital activity — to tax them on the revenue, rather than the profits, that they generate locally.","It depends on the motivation behind the tax, which I don’t understand."

Per Krusell,41,Stockholm University,m,2,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Greece would be better off if it had decided to exit the euro between 2011 and 2015.,
Per Krusell,42,Stockholm University,m,2,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question C: If Greece had defaulted on (or restructured) its private debt in 2010, while also staying within the euro, that combination would have been better for Greece than either exiting the euro or proceeding as it has actually done.",
Per Krusell,43,Stockholm University,m,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question A: Bitcoins are more similar to gold than they are to currency.,"It has no intrinsic value: like currency. Its liquidity: unclear, but similar w many currencies. It is a medium of exchange for criminals."
Per Krusell,44,Stockholm University,m,4,6,Agree,Disagree,Question B: Bitcoins are more similar to gold than they are to Dutch tulips in the 1630s.,Gold is also a medium of exchange though not a very liquid one.
Per Krusell,45,Stockholm University,m,2,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).",I'm quite uninformed on this issue!
Per Krusell,46,Stockholm University,m,5,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Over the past two years, all else equal, the appeal of the US as a destination for immigrants has changed in ways that will likely decrease innovation in the US economy.",President Trump is broadly disliked by highly educated people abroad and my GUESS is that these people think twice before moving to the U.S.

Per Krusell,48,Stockholm University,m,6,6,Uncertain,Strongly Disagree,"Question B: If other policies were held fixed and every European country taxed corporate profits at a common rate of 20%, then reducing that common rate substantially below 20% would make the average European better off.",It depends on how the resulting debt will be financed.
Per Krusell,49,Stockholm University,m,3,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: All else equal, if corporations throughout Europe set quotas for a minimum number of women board members, the shareholder value of European companies would increase.",Initially the reaction may be the opposite but my belief is that over the longer run it would be a plus. No data to back it up though!
Per Krusell,50,Stockholm University,m,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Taking into account the likely effects on investments in human capital by men and women, setting quotas throughout Europe for a minimum number of women board members would generate substantial net benefits for Europeans.",It's about making use of the talents of the entire population: good for prosperity. Much of management is (male) networking.
Per Krusell,51,Stockholm University,m,9,6,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: Subsidizing renewable energy sources is better than taxing fossil fuels, assuming the subsidy or tax would be set at levels that would reduce carbon emissions by an equivalent amount.",A tax is a more direct instrument for reducing emissions - the main goal - and R&D subsidies are at best an imperfect substitute.
Per Krusell,52,Stockholm University,m,8,5,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Germany’s solar-energy subsidies to date have produced net social benefits for Germany.,My understanding is that they have been very costly and not paid back for Germany.
Per Krusell,53,Stockholm University,m,5,5,Agree,Uncertain,Question C: Solar-energy subsidies to date in Germany and other countries have produced net social benefits for the world.,"The R&D has had benefits and the point is that they are global, not German-specific. I have not seen any cost-benefit analysis though."
Per Krusell,54,Stockholm University,m,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Insights from psychology about individual behavior – examples of which include limited rationality, low self-control, or a taste for fairness – predict several important types of observed market outcomes that fully-rational economic models do not.",
Per Krusell,55,Stockholm University,m,5,6,Disagree,Uncertain,The influx of refugees into Germany beginning in the summer of 2015 will generate net economic benefits for German citizens over the succeeding decade.,The adjustment likely takes longer (even though German labor markets allow low entry wages). Eventually the average benefits will be > 0.
Per Krusell,56,Stockholm University,m,8,6,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question A: Holding labor market institutions and job training fixed, rising use of robots and artificial intelligence is likely to increase substantially the number of workers in advanced countries who are unemployed for long periods.",Perhaps unemployment could rise in the short run but employment will respond to labor supply: there will be jobs.
Per Krusell,57,Stockholm University,m,9,6,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question B: Rising use of robots and artificial intelligence in advanced countries is likely to create benefits large enough that they could be used to compensate those workers who are substantially negatively affected for their lost wages.,If it is profitable to employ robots it is very likely more efficient. So almost by definition they increase production efficiency.
Per Krusell,58,Stockholm University,m,9,6,Strongly Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Consumers will be better off, on balance, if European cities treat firms that provide ride-sharing platforms (such as Uber) as substantively different from taxi firms, and thus not necessarily warranting the same regulation.",
Per Krusell,59,Stockholm University,m,9,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: Assuming that taxi and ride-sharing companies were treated as substantively similar — including requirements that they operate on an equal footing regarding safety, insurance and taxation — letting ride-sharing services compete without restrictions on prices or routes would raise consumer welfare.",
Per Krusell,60,Stockholm University,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Regardless of how ride-sharing services are treated, existing regulations for traditional taxi firms in many European cities harm consumers by limiting competition.",
Per Krusell,61,Stockholm University,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Revising France’s labor market policies — by reducing employment protection, decentralizing labor negotiations to the firm level, and making training programs more accessible and responsive to labor demands — would, all else equal, increase productivity in France’s economy.",Managing training programs is not necessarily so easy but I take the view that significant improvement is feasible.
Per Krusell,62,Stockholm University,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Reducing employment protection would reduce the equilibrium unemployment rate in France.,"It may not do so immediately. One can do a reform with grandfathering though, leaving currently employed workers with protection."
Per Krusell,63,Stockholm University,m,5,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: The ECB's asset purchases over the past two years have reduced the threat of deflation in the euro area as a whole.,
Per Krusell,64,Stockholm University,m,5,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: If the economic outlook in the euro area becomes less favorable, then increasing the ECB's asset purchase program (in size or duration) would substantially increase the euro area's economic growth over the following five years.",
Per Krusell,65,Stockholm University,m,9,9,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, absent any inside information, an equity investor can expect to do better by holding a well-diversified, low-fee, passive index fund than by holding a few stocks.",I don't know of any convincing systematic evidence to the contrary.
Per Krusell,66,Stockholm University,m,9,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Without changes in policy, a rising share of people who are over age 65 will exert a substantial downward influence on per capita real GDP in western European countries.",Mechanical argument but correct; behavioral responses exist but are limited.
Per Krusell,67,Stockholm University,m,9,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: In European countries where the share of those over 65 is rising, there are net social benefits to adjusting retirement ages for state-financed (including pay-as-you-go) pension systems upwards, so that revised retirement ages better reflect longer life expectancies.","To the extent there is cont'd general productivity growth and we get richer, people may want more leisure, but this effect is likely small."
Per Krusell,68,Stockholm University,m,2,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question A: All else equal, there are substantial advantages to having much of Europe’s human capital and infrastructure for international financial activity clustered in a single city, as they are at present in London.",It's not clear to me what the positive agglomeration activities are. Agglomeration can be bad too. But I'm far from an expert on this!
Per Krusell,69,Stockholm University,m,2,7,Disagree,Agree,"Question B: All else equal, Britain’s rules on hiring, firing and working hours are significantly more conducive to financial activity than those in other large European countries.",Not obvious that labor regulation is that relevant in this particular sector. It is in others but finance is full of other incentives.
Per Krusell,70,Stockholm University,m,3,7,Uncertain,Agree,"Question A: Setting the EU rules aside, and assuming it would take 2.5% of Italy’s GDP to recapitalize its banks, the Italian government would improve financial stability in Europe if it injected this amount of public funds into its banks.",I don't have enough info to say that it would help financial institutions elsewhere; depends on cross-holdings. In long run it's likely bad.
Per Krusell,71,Stockholm University,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,"Question B: If Italy were to inject public funds into its banks without imposing losses on at least some claimants, an important cost would be the effect on future incentives (economic or political) in Europe.",The expectations of future bailouts will likely be affected and induce excessive risk-taking.
Per Krusell,72,Stockholm University,m,NA,8,No Opinion,Strongly Agree,"On the whole, the shift from state to private ownership of many industrial assets in central and eastern European countries after communism has increased productivity in those countries.",I have no knowledge in this area.
Per Krusell,73,Stockholm University,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question A: Freer movement of people to live and work across borders within Europe has made the average western European citizen better off since the 1980s.,People migrate because they want to. Secondary effects are likely positive too.
Per Krusell,74,Stockholm University,m,8,6,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Freer movement of people to live and work across borders within Europe has made many low-skilled western European citizens worse off since the 1980s.,"Same as trade question. Some gain, some lose, also among low-skilled workers."
Per Krusell,75,Stockholm University,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Question A: Freer movement of goods and services across borders within Europe has made the average western European citizen better off since the 1980s.,"I am not a trade economist by specialization, which explains why I selected somewhat limited confidence."
Per Krusell,76,Stockholm University,m,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Freer movement of goods and services across borders within Europe has made many low-skilled western European citizens worse off since the 1980s.,I think mist low-wage competition is from outside of Europe. Of course some always lose from trade. But many low-skilled workers gain too.
Per Krusell,77,Stockholm University,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,"In general, using more congestion charges in crowded transportation networks — such as higher tolls during peak travel times in cities, and peak fees for airplane takeoff and landing slots — and using the proceeds to lower other taxes would make citizens on average better off.",this approach works in theory and seems to also work in practice
Per Krusell,78,Stockholm University,m,7,6,Strongly Disagree,Uncertain,Question A: Giving tax incentives to specific firms to locate operations in a country typically generates domestic benefits that outweigh the costs to the country providing the incentives.,this is good policy only if the government is able to select the right companies - which it is typically not
Per Krusell,79,Stockholm University,m,7,7,Disagree,Disagree,Question B: Europe as a whole benefits when European cities or countries compete with each other by giving tax incentives to firms to locate operations in their jurisdictions.,"if we think corporate taxes are too low this may be a good thing, but it is then better to just lower them across the board"
Per Krusell,80,Stockholm University,m,8,8,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Because of the Brexit vote's outcome, the UK's real per-capita income level is likely to be lower a decade from now than it would have been otherwise.","There is some small chance that the EU will malfunction badly in the future, in which case Brexit may be good ex post."
Per Krusell,81,Stockholm University,m,7,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Because of the Brexit vote's outcome, the rest of the EU's real per-capita income level is likely to be lower a decade from now than it would have been otherwise.",biggest risk is political: Brexit's anti-establishment message spreads. purely economic spillovers likely minor.
Peter Neary,1,Oxford,m,4,7,Agree,Agree,"Question A: Germany's current account surplus is undesirable even from a purely German viewpoint: the country would be better off if, for example, it ran a smaller primary surplus, in turn leading to a smaller current account surplus.","Surpluses defer consumption; doing this indefinitely makes no sense. That said, German opposition to inflation is understandably deep-rooted"
Peter Neary,2,Oxford,m,4,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: The Eurozone would be in better shape if fiscal policy were more expansionary, which would allow monetary policy to be slightly less so.","The current monetary-fiscal-policy disconnect is unsustainable. Provided it is prudent and targeted, expansionary fiscal policy makes sense"
Peter Neary,3,Oxford,m,4,8,Uncertain,Agree,"Question C: If there is a recession in the Eurozone, it will be essential to have a coordinated fiscal expansion.","""essential"" begs a lot of questions. Desirable definitely, though without new institutional structures, not clear how that can be effected"
Peter Neary,4,Oxford,m,4,5,Uncertain,Disagree,Question A: The European Union goal of reaching net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 will be a major drag on economic growth.,Growth may be lower; but could be lower still if environmental degradation proceeds unchecked. Markets undevalue environmental quality
Peter Neary,5,Oxford,m,5,6,Uncertain,Agree,Question B: Carbon taxes are a better way to implement climate policy than cap-and-trade.,"Both are good alternatives to command-and-control, incentivizing concern for environmental quality. The choice between them is contingent
-see background information here"
Peter Neary,6,Oxford,m,5,5,Disagree,Uncertain,Question C: A carbon border tax targeting imports from non-EU countries with less strict climate policies is likely to harm developing economies.,"Provided border taxes are not merely protectionist, they are likely to encourage better environmental policies in developing countries"
Peter Neary,7,Oxford,m,8,7,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: Following the UK election result, the certainty that the country is going to leave the European Union will provide a substantial short-term boost to the UK economy.","This could happen if confidence improves, but exchange rate fluctuations in the first post-election week suggest markets are unconvinced

Peter Neary,8,Oxford,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question B: Given that the transition period currently expires at the end of 2020, there is still a considerable risk that the UK will leave the European Union without a trade agreement.",UK policy seems focused on committing to leave hoping to get a better deal as a result. Unlikely to happen; EU has stronger bargaining power
Peter Neary,9,Oxford,m,1,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,Question C: Leaving the European Union without a trade agreement would have a large negative impact on the UK economy.,"All professionally-respected studies show that barriers with EU will impose economic costs for which no other trade agreement can compensate

Peter Neary,10,Oxford,m,3,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question A: Under current policies on climate change, the associated physical risks (such as those arising from total seasonal rainfall and sea level changes, and increased frequency, severity, and correlation of extreme weather events) will be at most a very small factor in monetary policy decisions over the next decade.",Extreme weather events may destabilize financial markets tho risks from global warming increasing pressure on migration are likely greater
Peter Neary,11,Oxford,m,3,6,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question B: The physical risks associated with climate change under current policies are likely to threaten financial stability over the next decade.,Very hard to forecast
Peter Neary,12,Oxford,m,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Europeans would benefit more from an extra €1 billion of public R&D spent through existing (public) channels than from an extra €1 billion of private R&D spent through existing (private) channels, all else equal.","In principle publicly funding R&D can respond better to social priorities and internalize spillovers. Doing so in practice is a challenge

Peter Neary,14,Oxford,m,3,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for answering some long unsettled questions in development economics research.,A great addition to economists’ toolkit - tho we should not expect too much of them
Peter Neary,15,Oxford,m,3,7,Agree,Agree,Question B: Randomized control trials are a valuable tool for making significant progress in poverty reduction.,Significant? Yes. Quantitatively important? Not in all cases. Need to keep the Deaton-Pritchett qualifications in mind
Peter Neary,16,Oxford,m,3,7,Agree,Uncertain,Question A: Having companies run to maximize shareholder value creates significant negative externalities for workers and communities.,"I agree with this statement, though maximizing shareholder value also encourages efficient profit-making which has social value"
Peter Neary,17,Oxford,m,4,6,Agree,Uncertain,"Question B: Appropriately managed corporations could create significantly greater value than they currently do for a range of stakeholders – including workers, suppliers, customers and community members – with small impacts on shareholder value.","Modern corporations should be regulated, including anti-trust, regulation to ensure compliance with environmental and labor standards, etc."
Peter Neary,18,Oxford,m,4,6,Uncertain,Disagree,"Question C:
Effective mechanisms for boards of directors to ensure that CEOs act in ways that balance the interests of all stakeholders would be straightforward to introduce.",Regulation is a multi-faceted goal; legistating on the composion of boards of directors may not be a good instrument to achieve it
Peter Neary,19,Oxford,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,Question A: Rising inequality is straining the health of liberal democracy.,Rising inequality is a contributing factor; but real or imagined threats from immigration are more salient in Europe. Populists exploit both
Peter Neary,20,Oxford,m,6,7,Agree,Uncertain,Question B: Enacting more redistributive expenditures and policies would be likely to limit the rise of populism in Europe.,Announcement effects of such policies could have short-term benefits; but the direct effects will only be long-term
Peter Neary,21,Oxford,m,6,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: European governments should allocate more resources to policies that would be likely to limit the rise of populism in Europe, even if it means higher public debt or lower public spending in other areas.","Retreating from austerity in UK, or boosting Eurozone aggregate demand, plus efforts to reduce inequality should help, if sold positively"
Peter Neary,22,Oxford,m,4,7,Disagree,Uncertain,"Question A: At this point, there is little that the European Central Bank can do to increase or maintain output in the Eurozone.","ECB can’t do much given low interest rates, but I can stop things getting worse"
Peter Neary,23,Oxford,m,5,7,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B: When the economy is operating below its potential, larger fiscal deficits are likely to increase demand and output.",Only models with implausible degrees of wage/price flexibility predict otherwise.
Peter Neary,24,Oxford,m,4,7,Agree,Uncertain,"Question C: When the economy is operating below its potential and monetary policy is at the effective lower bound, fiscal policy should prioritize increasing output over decreasing public debt.","Agree, but this is more a political/moral judgement than a scientifically grounded view. And depends on circumstances, esp. size of deficit"
Peter Neary,25,Oxford,m,7,8,Agree,Agree,Question A: Selecting candidates for membership of the ECB Executive Board based primarily on nationality ahead of competence is likely to have a negative effect on the quality of monetary policy in the Eurozone.,"""Competence"" should be interpreted broadly: commanding academic respect but also with personal, political and administrative skills"
Peter Neary,26,Oxford,m,6,8,Uncertain,Agree,"Question B: Although the central bank can never be an entirely technocratic institution, the selection process for the ECB President and members of the Executive Board is significantly worsened by intergovernmental trade-offs involving appointments to other European institutions.",The track record to date is not bad. Hopefully this will continue. It would clearly be worrying if the post became totally politicized.
Peter Neary,27,Oxford,m,5,5,Uncertain,Disagree,"On bids for infrastructure projects, the average European would be better off if Europe’s governments favored European firms over Chinese firms (or firms from any other country with non-profit-related geopolitical strategies) — even if it means sometimes choosing a higher-cost bidder.",It depends. The trade-off is between security and buying from the best supplier. Excluding all foreign bidders is just protectionism.
Peter Neary,28,Oxford,m,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,Question A: Breaking the “doom loop” — a negative spiral that can result when banks hold sovereign bonds and governments bail out banks — would increase the stability of European economies in the event of another financial crisis.,
Peter Neary,29,Oxford,m,NA,8,Did Not Answer,Agree,Question B: Regulators should try to break the doom loop by assigning positive risk weights — in calculating banks’ capital requirements — to banks’ holdings of domestic and other Eurozone sovereign bonds.,
Peter Neary,30,Oxford,m,NA,8,8,Uncertain,Question C: Breaking the doom loop would impose substantial costs on powerful political constituencies.,

Peter Neary,34,Oxford,m,4,5,Agree,Uncertain,"Question A: Overall, public spending on the arts in Europe creates benefits that exceed the deadweight loss caused by taxation to fund it.",This is a value judgement not a statement about efficiency.

But details matter"
Peter Neary,38,Oxford,m,2,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,Question A: Letting publicly traded European firms report earnings annually rather than quarterly would lead their executives to place more weight on long-term issues in their investments and other decisions.,Not my specialty. I would expect source of funding rather than frequency of reporting to be more important in promoting long-term thinking
Peter Neary,39,Oxford,m,2,5,Uncertain,Uncertain,"Question B: A switch from quarterly to annual earnings reports would, on net, benefit shareholders of European firms.","Same answer as to (A), with the added proviso that long-term thinking may be good for society but not necessarily for all shareholders"
Peter Neary,40,Oxford,m,8,5,Disagree,Disagree,"Question A: To the extent that public corporations pursue social and environmental initiatives, they tend to achieve higher risk-adjusted (private) returns than otherwise similar corporations that pursue such initiatives less.","An old debate. John Stuart Mill nailed it: private sector to maximize efficiency; public to look after distribution, social goals etc."
Peter Neary,41,Oxford,m,7,5,Agree,Agree,Question B: To the extent that Norway’s global government pension fund makes investments for social and environmental objectives — apart from investments that would bring the highest expected risk-adjusted returns — it improves the welfare of Norwegians.,Weakly agree; tho main benefit of the Norwegian fund is as the poster-boy of how to manage windfalls to mitigate the natural resource curse

Effects on congestion unlikely to be significant
Peter Neary,46,Oxford,m,8,8,Strongly Agree,Agree,"Question B:
To achieve a given level of congestion, it would be better to use taxes for driving that vary based on the level of congestion, rather than limiting the number of ride-sharing vehicles.",Singapore pioneered road pricing decades ago. Sad that it has not been more widely copied. Scarce resources given away freely makes no sense

Pol Antras,63,Harvard,m,NA,6,No Opinion,Uncertain,"The US spends roughly 17% of GDP on healthcare, according to the OECD; most European countries spend less than 12% of GDP.

Higher quality-adjusted US healthcare prices contribute relatively more to the extra US spending than does the combination of higher quantity and quality of US care (interpreting quantity and quality to reflect both greater American healthcare needs due to underlying population health and the delivery of more or better healthcare services to Americans).",The question is far from my field of expertise so I don't have strong views. But I can't wait to hear what the experts have to say about it!

Richard Portes,78,London Business School,m,8,7,Agree,Agree,"Question C: Regardless of how ride-sharing services are treated, existing regulations for traditional taxi firms in many European cities harm consumers by limiting competition.","Licensing to confirm competences and confer corresponding privileges OK, but not to create rents through barriers to entry."

Public funds necessary though not sufficient.
