the EU is one economy, some countries will always run a surplus/deficit; there is no point in balancing the current account by country.;There are pros and cons, as some countries have hard-to sustain government debt levels, others not. Thus, a case by case analysis is needed.;Fiscal policies in the Eurozone are by and large regional/national decisions, so coordination may be either not justified, or not needed.;The policy will require significant public and private investments, allowing for knock-on effects that are likely to spur growth.;The big difference is the ""cap"" - without it, taxes may distort investment and consumption, but will not necessarily reduce emissions.;The question leaves open whether or not the border tax is accompanied by higher levies for CO2 production within borders.;The demise of the ""fork"" (in versus out) reduces ambiguity greatly, allowing longer term planning once again.;I don't thing that the EU on the other side of the table will play hard ball - they will rather give in, allowing for a trade arrangement.;This is too complicated a case to think it through properly now.;The answer is ""uncertain"", because I fear political pressure combined with central bank hubris may lead to action based on a false positive;;I believe in the direct plus indirect benefit of basic research, which is more likely to be public rather than private R&D.;Public R&D may have positive second round effects in the form of private R&D, whereas the opposite is less likely to happen.;This is an overall YES, because it addresses directly the identification problem, thereby hinting at effective policy instruments.;The fact that I learn something about causality does not imply implementing isolated changes (of instruments) in the real world is easy.;There is a route to maximizing shareholder value while simultaneously upholding stakeholder utility: That is German Ordnungspolitik.;In its generality, the statement is hard to disagree with...;Long term profitability will not be maximized when other stakeholders' interests are manifestly violated.;Not inequality per se undermines democracy, but the degree to which being rich or poor becomes hereditary.;Populism - as today's new nationalism - is driven by doubts about future living standard and way of life, rather than inequality at home.;Fighting populism-nationalism needs bold decisions promoting a sense of relevance and pride for European politics. That is no spending issue;The ECB can influence output via interest rates if and only if the investment function is monotonic everywhere. But this may not be true.;There are two caveats in the statement: first, output is below potential, and second, Ricardian equivalence does not hold.;I disagree because of unconditional nature of the statement. What if Ricardian equivalence holds, and investment function bends backwards?;Yes, a negative influence is possible because national elctorates may believe ""their"" agent will bias his/her decisions.;The phrase overstates the effective influence of trade-offs. An appointment balance may help to achieve mutual recognition, given quality.;The response to geopolitical interests is a wise strong set of conditionalities if awarded, rather than exclusion from the bidding process.;In the Eurozone, banks' home bias creates bankruptcy risk because states cannot print the money needed to redeem their debt.;I only weakly agree, because there are second order effects of risk weights, and there are better alternatives, like concentration limits.;Second order (political) effects of changing risk weights are only poorly understood.;Too homogeneous a neighborhood in inner cities, as wel as in ""les banlieues"", may undermine cohesion and solidarity in society at large.;“Fully implemented” implies implementation in a way that minimizes moral hazard, e.g. through a European reinsurance scheme.;No, it would not iprovided it is implemented cleverly, e.g. relying on a reinsurance scheme.;Clearly, the statement is subject to decreasing marginal returns, so the optimal amount of spending is finite.;Given the high level of public spending on the arts in Europe, we may have reached the point of negative marginal returns in some countries.;There are pros and cons, and I do not see easily how to weigh these arguments...;;The point is that Board-level brain-time needed to justify volatile results is reduced to an -arguably- more reasonable time span.;Board-level brain time is redirected to longer horizons - which on balance may benefit shareholders.;It is an unlikely combination, doing good and having private benefits too.;There is an emotional benefit in pursuing such an investment stratategy that may be relevant here.;The rule itself should be rock-solid, the user should herself select the buffers required to achieve the desired degree of flexibility.;It increasese default probability through its indirect effect on future debt incentives; while the direct effect may be negligible.;As in the case of Italy, rule-breaking carries the risk of repetition, although to a lessor extent for France.;Too many side and cross effects to consider in order to arrive at a ""safe"" welfare conclusion.;The marginal cost of adding or subtracting vehicles instantly, according to traffic status, is lower with ride-sharers than with cabs.;As employment rate among migrants goes up over time, and much of taxation is indirect anyway, chances are that the statement comes true.;;Often, in public debate, external forces and uncontrolled markets are blamed for poor economic performance, not true own political omissions;Autonomous cars are relevant for urban areas, whereas smartphones have affected the life of almost everybody, thus a larger welfare effect.;Quite an absurd suggestion, vastly overestimating what monetary policy can achieve - in the end frustrating central bankers and the public.;A ""fair"" digital tax should allocate the tax base (profits) virtually among producer and consumer countries; a 3% tax may start negotiations;Yes, but profit taxation requires negotiations between countries to share the tax base (unlikely to work in todays protectionist world);A generalized answer to this question needs to be specify a particular industry. In banking I do not agree, in others I don't know enough.;Trade with China, as with other countries, is of a reciprocal nature, and it helps Europeans (and Chinese) in consumption and employment.;This statement is in a way a no-brainer. But it begs the question whether it does not also help affected European producers to find a niche.;I do not believe in strategic trade policy as an instrument of welfare improvement: European and Chinese welfare are not substitutes.;Greece is now back on track, has accepted many hardships in order to comply with European requests - why should it change its stance?;Exiting a currency union is tough.

Sum=?;We will see lots of changes, not only robots coming in. But also very different ways of working, leading also to shorter employment spells.;Absolutely. But mind the term ""could"". Whether or not it happens depends critically on fundamental adjustments of our societal architecture.;Exempting ride sharing services from existing regulations would put taxi firms at an imposed disadvantage, undermining efficiency.;;Welfare is affected by two effects, reduced competition (a minus), and increased safety/reliability (a plus). The sum is thus indeterminate.;The second policy option in the list (decentralized labor negotiations) may backfire, boosting strike incentives and lowering productivity.;I only note in passing that the relationship between equilibrium unemployment rate and welfare is likely to be non-monotonic.;APP has desired real effects iff credit supply is the problem, not demand, nor structural reform. Moreover, is mild deflation a threat?;APP may have opposite effect: Expectations of unsustainable debt levels at states and banks leading to low interest rates & low growth.;A quant hedge fund may extract extra return by big data strategies, but an average guy, like myself, will likely fail with stock-picking.;The emphasis is on ""without change in policy"" - but it is those changes that will weigh heavily on the policy agenda, e.g. retirement age.;Increasing retirement age will go hand in hand with changing work conditions. As a consequence, productivity of elderly is likely to rise.;For hub-and-spoke structure, we need to balance agglomeration synergy against systemic risk externality (created at hub, borne by spokes).

-see background information here;While productivity has increased almost surely, production may actually have dropped significantly, as industry was largely dismantled.;Welfare comparisons are hard to substantiate. Moreover, note the identification problem: EU trade and migration happened simultaneously.;Freer migration has increased GDP, and thus has raised transfers to lower-skilled people. The balance, I believe (!), may well be positive.;Citizens, not workers or consumers are evaluated. Gains from trade have probably increased in terms of averaging across Europeans.;Gains from trade have increased the extent to which redistribution via the social security system can be effective.;Note that crowdedness is endogenous, and an allocation of proceeds to all citizens (rather than other transportation users) is third best.;While benefits are consummated locally, negative externalities and allocative distortions are largely outside the country.;Compare innovation and competition (pro) with rent seeking and allocative distortions (contra). For Europe, the ""contra"" argument dominates.;Think of the EU as a collective good with some redistributive features.

I suspect a bare-bones trade deal (zero tarrifs & quotas, no services) can be done;This (rather than failure to sort out the other issues in the WA) is the biggest chance that Brexit has a large sudden negative shock.;It's not clear climate change will be a major issue for central banks over this period, particularly given the narrow remit that many have.;I could be wrong here. There could be tipping point events where climate emergencies become a major financial issue.;Not an easy question. Private R&D more likely to spent in zero-sum competitions for market share and establishing dominant market positions.;Similarly, much of the benefit of private medical R&D goes to profits made by drug producers.;;;This could be the case (e.g. if profit maximizing involved polluting the environment) but these cases are best dealt with via regulation.;I'm not sure there is sufficient empirical evidence to back up this statement.;Why would this be easy? It's a really complex issue.;More a political science question than an economics one. Stagnant median earnings perhaps a greater issue than inequality per se.;Europe already does plenty of redistribution. And some populist parties (Brexit\Lega) actually have anti-redistribution policy platforms.;Unclear to me which areas of spending would do this. Better to evaluate spending proposals on their objective merits.;With an unemployment rate of 7.5% there is still spare capacity in the EA. ECB can also boost investment which increases supply capacity.;There is plenty of empirical evidence for this proposition.;Generally true though not, for example, in highly-indebted members of the Euro Area which do not have control of their own currency.;ECB President is a key job and much has depended in recent years on Draghi's decisions.

It may suit some to do more than others.;Hard to sum this up with such a short question. All countries have an interest in co-operative behavior that reduces risks of climate change;The rules should focus on maintaining overall debt sustainability and not on randomly chosen figures (such as deficit limits of 3 percent).;Insolvency risk is driven by loss of market confidence and failure to roll over existing debt. This government is close to provoking this.;France has lower debt\GDP and there is far less likelihood of a bond market ""strike"" on buying French debt. 3 percent is an arbitrary limit.;Arbitrary caps on numbers employed in specific industries are unlikely to ever deliver good outcomes.;Capping numbers of a specific group of drivers is not an efficient or useful way to deal with congestion.;;Nonrivalry of ideas is important for growth and means there are positive externalities to research.

The debt is unsustainable (see the recent CEPR report) but there will likely be debt relief thus avoiding an outright default.;Better to have larger sovereign default in 2011 restoring sustainability and avoiding the excessively tight fiscal policy of 2012 onwards.;Euro membership provided stability and low interest rates. The damage was done by ""debt denial "" and excessively tight fiscal policy.;On the relative similarity I agree but gold has actual uses (e.g. jewellery) which gives it some value.

Would also bring some relatively lower productivity workers into employment This would lower average productivity;It is likely that high levels of employment protection raise the natural rate of unemployment. But this is just one of many factors.;QE is complex but most careful research shows it impacts long-term rates. ECB program has definitely reduced sovereign borrowing rates.;The disagreement is because of the word ""substantial"". Not sure that any realistic policy can ""substantially"" improve European growth rates.;;;;There may be some wider advantages for Europe due to the clustering of financial service activity in London but it is likely to be small.;I don't believe labour laws in France, Germany or Ireland, for example, will be a deterring factor for financial service firms.;This may improve financial stability in the short-run but probably sets a bad fiscal precedent for other European governments in the future.;This would undermine the EU's BRRD approach though it always seemed likely loss imposition was more a policy intended for small countries.;Agree but moving from state-sponsored monopolies to badly-regulated private sector monopolies does not do much for the average consumer.;Agree, though effects on the average person are not the same as on every person.;Empirical evidence on effects of migration from Eastern Europe suggest limited effects on wages in the UK for example.;I agree but evidence on productivity suggests that the gains from this kind of liberalisation have been smaller than anticipated.;Eastern European immigration has had limited effects on wages in Western Europe.
